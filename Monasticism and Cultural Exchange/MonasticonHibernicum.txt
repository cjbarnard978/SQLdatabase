the ſucceſſors of St. Peter ever exerciſed Apoſtolic as 
mination. It was aftet much trouble and civil com- 
mot ion, that penal laws and a ſteady | 
_ tiff adminiſtration diſſolved our connection with Rome, 
_ and eſtabliſhed a partial Proteſtaniſm. Partial, we ſay, 

becauſe from the following nomenclature of one Monk 


iſh order, it will appear, how rooted is the affection 


of the leſs intelligent natives for the Monaſtic inſtitution. 


Doctor Burke, late titular Biſhop: 'of Oſſory, ſtates 


1 in his Hibernia Dominicana, that in the year 17 56, 
there were Monks of the order of St. Dominick in 


Aghaboe, one; Arklow, two; Athenry, nine; Athy, 


three; Ballindown, three; Buried five; Car- 
lingford, four; Caſhel, fire; Cavan, four; Clonſttan- 


vill, five; Coleraine, two; ; Cork, five; Derry, nine; | 
Drogheda, in coutity of Fm eight; Dublin, nine; 


Galway, nine; Glanore, four; Gola, three; Kil- 
| kenny, four; Kilmallock, three; Limevdeks,: five; 

Longford, three; Lorrah, two; Mullingar, fix ; Naas, 
four; Newtown, in County of Down, three; Por- 
tumna, two; Rathbran, five; Rofbercon, two; Roſ- 
comon, fixteen; Sligo, Frey Strade, ſeven; Tom- 


beola, three; Tralee, two; Trim, ſeven ;\ Urlare, fix ; 


Waterford, three; and 'Youghall; three; umu 


in the whole to one kuudred and eighty one. The 


Franciſcans are much more numerous, and the other 


orders have many members, all of them preſerving the

INTRODUCTION. 


near their ancient Monaſteries. F com ſuch à ſucceſ- 


ſion it might be imagined, that there could not be a 


geearth of chartularies, regiſters, leger-books, obitua- 
ries, and other evidences of the origin and ſtate of our 


Abbies; but this is far from being the caſe. The va- 


rious convulſions, which Ireland experienced, baniſh- 
ed many of her religious to the Continent ; ſome of 
our ecclefiaſtical records were carried away, but much 
more were loſt in the turbulence of the times. Hap- 


pily the 1 inquiries of Sir Robert Cotton, Archbiſhop 
Uſher, and Sir James Ware, impreſſed a value on 


ſuch n eee 50 eee them from total de-

tiqnary and claims our warmeſt praiſe for giving us the 
firft idea of an Iriſh Monaſteriology ; Dodſworth and 
Dugdale were printing the Monaſticon Anglicanum, 
when the firſt edition of Ware's Diſquiſitiones was 
publiſhed; he was too far advanced in life, and too 
much involved in public buſineſs, to follow their exam- 
ple, though he had ample materials to rival them, which 


unfortunately were afterwards diſperſed. He contented 


| himſelf, therefore, with an outline, tolerably correct, 
of our cenobitic eſtabliſhments, but very imperfect as 
to their private hiſtory and property. In the year 1690, 
M. Allemande enlarged Ware's catalogue from the 
hiſtoriographers of the different Monaſtie orders, which 


work was tranſſated from the French, and printed,

with additions, in 1722, by a Captain John Stevens. 
Mr. Harris, the Editor of Ware, threw this ſubject 


into an analytical form; but he has treated it in ſo 
contracted a manner, as to o afford 0 little or no ſa-

It is much to be inden ithat the fat 1 


writer, who had great opportunities. of conſulting re- 


cords in England and Ireland, and ſpent, a long life in 


ſuch purſuits, | was not more copious. However, the 


ſkeleton was formed, ang the next labour was to give 
it a body. The late learned Doctor Pococke, Biſhop 
of Oſſory and of Meath, (to whom the Author had the 


honour of being domeſtic chaplain) whilſt his Lordſhip 
preſided in the: ſee of Oſſory, frequently noticed the 
defects of our Monaſtic hiſtory, and urged the neceſſity 


of its improvement; he pointed out the method here 
adopted, procured many neceſſary documents, and 
had the goodneſs to encourage the Author with ſolid 
favours. The work was difficult, . and required unre- 
mitted perſeverance. Authentic vouchers were not 
eaſily had, even when they were, it was no ſmall la- 
bour to decipher muſty and wormeaten manuſeripts, 


and aſcertain their contents. 


After inceſſant toil for many years, 6 no inconſi- 
derable expence, it may be aſked, why an epitome of 
theſe records and documents was preferred, to giving 


as 
they would have made at leaſt two volumes 901555 if 


publiſhed 


other collections, to the world!

publiſted! in their original ſtate, the tune of a pri- 


vate clergyman could not be adequate to ſuch an ex- 


pence, and this Biſhop Pococke early foreſaw. The 


public are certainly loſers by the defalcation ; for 


ſcarce a family of note, in England or Ireland, who 
may not, at ſome period, trace their pedigree in the 


ſubſcriptions to our Monaſtic charters and donations, 
and find remains of their property both before aud after 
the diſſolution of theſe ſocieties. 

Whenever the generoſity of Parliament, or the li- 
berality of individuals, ſhall encourage a publication 
ſimilar to the Monaſticon Anglicanum, they will rear 
a fair and everlaſting monument to their honour ; and 
ſhould theſe pages contribute W the completion of 
ſuch a work, the Author having ſerved his country, 
even thus 5 will be amply recompenced for his 
humble labours:—he cannot however lay down his pen, 
without acknowledging the high and unexpected ho- 


nour conferred by the Right Hon. the Earls of Clan- 


braffill (a) and Roden; (b) theſe noblemen (liberal 
and polite) not only Permitted the Author to explore 


the treaſures of their reſpective offices, but allowed him 
to offer the fruits of his reſearches, connected with his

Tullyaſnech, Tiretragh, Tireneſagart, and Downe. (u) 

By an inquiſition taken the firſt year of K. James, 1603, it appears, 
that the abbot was alſo ſeized of a third-part of a quarter of, land near 
Newton, in the county of Tyrone, called the Grange, containing a .plough- 
land of the yearly y value of one ſhilling;; that he was alſo ſeized, of A car- 
rucate of land at the Curragh, by the rent of twelve-pence yearly, pay- 
able to the heirs of Theobald de Verdon, to, wit, to Thomas F urneval, 
who married Joan, the daughter of the ſaid Theobald. (C 

This abbey, and all the poſſeſſions thereunto belonging, were granted, 
in May 1612, to A Toby Caufield, Knight, at the rent of five Pounqs 
Iriſh. (x)

By another inquiſition taken March 24th, 162 5 it appears, "I the 


prior, with his brethren, had totally forſaken the priory, and were all dead 


about twenty- five years before the holding of this inquiſition; that Sir Toby 
Caulfield, Lord Charlemount, had about the year 1620 received, as ſeneſ- 
chal to Henry, then archbiſhop of Armagh, the rents of the ſaid bally- 
boes, and that John Symons, clerk, had, from the feaſt of All Saints, 
1623, to the day of the taking of this inquiſition, received the profits of 
the ſaid ballyboes, and of the tenements in the town of Armagh; that 


the rent of the ſeven townlands was 46l. and that Symons had expended

January 9, 1618, king James granted the monaſteries of Temple Far- COUNTY

Dominican FRxIARY; 


Porter in his annals tells us, that there was ene at Armagh; which is 
more than probable, otherwiſe the primate Scanlain, who was of that or- 
der, would not have made his foundation for the friars minor. (o) 


FRANCISCAN FRIARY; 


The friars of the order of St. Francis were brought into this town 
A. D. 1261( p), and Patrick Scanlain, who was then primate, built a 


houſe for them two years after (q); though Wadding, the Franciſcan, as 

quoted by Allemande, aſſures us, that it was founded, in the year 1291, 
by O'Donnel. (r) | 

Michael, the divinity lecturer, was elected archbiſhop i in 1303. (s) 

A. D. 1353. Gormlagh, the daughter of J. O'Donnel, and formerly 


wife of Donald O'Neil, prince of Ulſter, dying on the 14th of April, 


was buried in this monaſtery. (t) 


The Franciſcans of the ſtri& obſervance began to reform this friary in 
1518 (u), but it was not then perfected. In 1580, Walter M*Cuard was 


of 
ARMAGH. 


guardian (w), and in 1583, Solomon M*<Conny was guardian, in whoſe 


time the reformation was compleated. (x) 


CLONFEAKLE; 


St. Lugud, or Lugaid, the ſon of Tailchan, was abbot of Cluain-fiacul, . 


that is, the church of the Tooth, ſo named from a tooth of St. Patrick 
which was ſaid to have been preſerved here. St. Lugud was a very aged 
man in the year 580. (y) 


Clonfeakle is now a pariſh church, about five miles Ren Armagh. 2) |

Two miles ſouth of Carigaline, in the barony of Kinalea. An abbey, 
called the abbey de Alba tractu, and dedicated to the Virgin Mary (p). 


was founded here A. D. 1224, by M*Carthy (q), who furniſhed it with 


monks of the Ciſtertian order from the * of Alba landa, or White- 


land, in Carmardenſhire, in Wales. (r) 
A. D. 1031. In this year, the 29th of the reign of King Edward I. the 


abbot was indicted for receiving and protecting his nephew, Maurice 
Ruſſell, who had committed a rape on a Engliſh woman, he was found 
_ guilty, and fined in the ſum of 40 pounds. (s)

In che pariſh of Templecarn, and barony of Tirhugh; in this Lough there 
are ſeveral iffands, the largeſt is called the ifland of St. Dabeoc, ſome call 
it St. Fintan's iſland, and others the iſland of Saints (m). In this iſland 
was a priory of canons regular following the rule of St. Auguſtin, which 
was dedicated to the Saints Peter and Paul (n), and founded, as ſome 
ſay, by the great apoſtle of Ireland, but others give the foundation to St. 
Daboec (o), who was alſo called Mobeoc and Beonan ; he was brother to 
St. Canoc, who flouriſhed: about the year 492. St. Dabeoc is patron of 
this church, where three feſtivals are held to. his honour yearly, on the 
rſt of January, 24th of July, and 16th of December (p). St. Dabeoc is 
ſaid to have been buried in this abbey, which he made ſubject to the great 


5 abbey of Armagh; it had a fine chapel, with convenient houſes for the 


monks, the remains af which may yet be ſcen.(q). One of the Saint 


Patricks was prior here about the year. 850. (r) 


_ Notwithſtanding the reputed holineſs of this i manaſtery, it 
was plundered and reduced to aſhes by Bratachas * and M*Mahan 


A. D. 120% (8s). John was prior in 1353. (t 


St. Patrick's purgatory, as it is called, was firſt fixed in this. iſland, 


wr RI to the ſhane, and a bridge from the main land givi 


the people a free and eaſy acceſs into it, the cave was cloſed up, and ano- 


ther was opened 1 in a leſſer iſland, about half a mile from the ſhore, Some 


people have given the invention of this purgatory to the great St. Patrick, 


but others, with more probability, aſcribe it to Patrick who was prior 


here about the year 8 50 (u). This purgatory continued a long time in 


high repute both at home and abroad. We find, in our records, ſeveral 


ſafe conducts. granted by the Kings of England to foreigners deſirous, to 


viſit it, and particularly in the year 1358, to Maleteſta Ungarus, Knt. 


another bearing the ſame date, to Nicholas de Beccario, a nobleman of 


Ferraria (w); and in 1397, one to Raymond, Viſcount de Perilleux and 


Knight of Rhodes, with a train of 20 men and 30 horſes (x). But this

in the year 1497, by the father guardian of the Franciſcans of Donegall,

The extent of this iſland is ſcarcely three quarters of an Iriſh acre ; the

„ 1126, or 1127, founded an abbey for monks of the order of St. Benedict, 
DOWN. and called it the abbey of Carrig, from the rock on which it was erected. 
St. Evodius was the firſt abbot; and, on the day of his deceaſe, he gave 
directions that his corpſe ſhould be interred in the iſland of Inis, after - 
wards Iniſcourcey, prophecying, that his own abbey would in after-times 
be deſtroyed, but that one ſhould be built on that iſland. This abbey 
continued of the Benedictin order during the times of Odo, Devincius, 
and John, the three ſucceeding abbots, but in the government of the lat- 
ter it was given to the Ciſtertian order, and made a daughter of the ab- 
bey of Furnes. At the conqueſt of Ulſter, Sir John de Courcey ung 
deſtroyed this houſe, it having been converted into a fortification again

BALDONGAN; 


IN the n of Balruddery, Wi the country of 1 2 5 

The Knights Templars, according to ſome 
dedicated to the Virgin Mary. ( 

The caſtle of Baldongan is about two miles from the Fog and i is boldly 
and conſpicuouſly fituated on a riſing ground, commanding an extenſive 
proſpe& of the circumjacent country. It conſiſts, on the weſt end, of 
two large ſquare towers, with a parapet in front covering a paſſage be- 
tween each; from theſe towers a regular building. is carried on each ſide, 
but narrower, to which a fimilar tower is joined at the north eaſt angle, 
but at the ſouth caſt angle is only a ſmaller tower, in which are the 
ſtairs leading to the battlements, and on the front are the arms of the 
Lords of Howth. 5 

The tradition of the place ſays, that this caſtle had been at different 
times a friary and a nunnery, that whilſt it was a nunnery, it was 
beſieged by a party of armed men, and that the nuns, in a fit of de- 
ſpair, threw themſelves. from the windows. It appears to have been 
erected in the 13th. century, and to have been intended rather for the 
lordy: habitation. of fome proud baron, than fon a place of defence; it 
was the ſeat of Richard Birmingham, Eſq. whoſe fiſter and heireſs Anne, 
married Sir Chriſtopher St. Lawrence, Lord of Howth, who died 2oth of

M ON AS TIC ON 


O r TY On the preſent occaſion we are fortunately relieved from theſe difficul- 
DUBLIN. ties by the teſtimony of a venerable record, the Black Book of Chriſt 
8 Church, which informs us, that about the year of our Lord 1038, Sitric, 
the ſon of Ableb, or rather Aulif, the Daniſh Prince of Dublin, gave to 
Donat, biſhop of that ſee, a place, where the arches or vaults were found- 

ed, to ere& a church to the honour of the Bleſſed Trinity. 

Ware, Harris, and other antiquaries who have mentioned theſe circum- 
ſtances, give us the extract without e any elucidation, which how- 
ever it ſeems to call for. 

From the Practice of thoſe ages (p) we know,” that it was foal to build 
ſmall oratories, and to arch that part in which the ſhrine of the Saint, or 
other ſacred depoſit was placed. The ſtone roofing prevented accidents 
from fire, and at the fame time preſerved a reference to thoſe cryptical 
monaſtic cells, then held in general veneration. When a large edifice was 
conſtructed, as was particularly the caſe at Caſhell, theſe ancient vaulted 
oratories were religiouſly preſerved, and were looked on as indubitable 
proofs of the antiquity and holineſs of the church. From this explana- 
tion and inſtance, a doubt cannot be entertained of theſe arches being the 
foundation of an ancient oratory, and which the donations of Sitric en- 
larged and furniſhed with convenient and neceſſary offices; for ſo the 

words “ ſufficienter ad zdihicandam eceleſiam e cum tota curia' are to be 
interpreted. [ed | 

The father and grandfather of Sitric ded on their journey to Rome, 
the faſhionable tour of thoſe days, and Sitric ſeems to have been actuated 
with the ſame love of religion which ſo eminently diſtinguiſhed his family. 
Additional credit is derived to this record from the times of Sitric and 
Donat ſynchronizing; ſo that it may be aſſumed as certain, that the 
church was begun about the period now aſſigned. 

The grants of Sitric were not many, as his territory was cicumibribed, 5 
and lay moſtly on the ſea coaſt; but he beſtowed on them the lands of 
Bealdulech, or Baldoyle, Rechen and Portrahern, with their villains, cows, 
and corn; and Donat built an epiſcopal palace contiguous to the church. 
The religious of this community were ſecular canons, not tied to the ob- 

ſervance of ſtrict monaſtic rules, or belonging to any of the cenobitical or- 
ders; yet they were a ſort of monks lax in diſcipline, and bound to ſuch 
regulations as the biſhop preſcribed. On the advancement of Laurence 
O” Toole to the ſee of Dublin in A. D. 1163, he made them canons regu- 
lar of the order of Arras, a branch of the Auguſtinians.

Fitz Stephen, brought from Armagh, and beſtowed upon this church, a 
ſtone altar and the moſt holy ſtaff of Jeſus, which St. Patrick uſed to carry 
in his hands (e). We find in Ware's hiſtory of the biſhops, that after the 


death of Maurice M*Donald, .arch-biſhop of Armagh, in the year 1134, 
Nigel M*Aid uſurped that ſee, taking away with him, ſays St. Bernard 


in his life of Malachy, the ornaments of the church, ſuch as the text of the 
goſpels which had belonged to St. Patrick, and a ſtaff covered with gold 
and ſet with precious ſtones, called the ſtaff of Jeſus ; in ſuch reverence 
were theſe reliques held, that whoever poſſeſſed them was eſteemed the 
rightful poſſeſſor of the ſee. The hiſtory of this celebrated ſtaff, as: deli- 
vered by Joceline, is briefly this: St. Patrick, moved by divine inſtinct,

in the Tyrrhene ſea (f), a man of exemplary virtue and moſt holy life. DUBLIN. 


After mutual ſalutations and diſcourſe, he preſented the Iriſh Apoſtle with 
a ſtaff which he averred he had received from the hands of - Jeſus Chriſt 


himſelf. In this iſland were ſome men in the bloom of youth, and others 


who appeared aged and decrepit; St. Patrick converſing with them, found 
that thoſe aged perſons were ſons of thoſe ſeemingly young; aſtoniſhed at 
this miraculous appearance, he was told, that from their infancy they 
« had ſerved God, that they were conftantly employed in works of cha- 
* rity, and their doors ever open to the traveller and diſtreſſed; that 
& one night a ſtranger, with a ſtaff in his hand, came to them, le: 
< they accommodared to the beſt of their power; that in the morning he 
<« bleſſed them, and ſaid, I am Jeſus Chriſt whom you have always faith- 
« fully ſerved; but laſt night you received me in my proper perſon ; he 
e then gave his ſtaff to their ſpiritual father, with directions to deliver it 
< to à ſtranger named Patrick, who would ſhortly viſit them; on faying 
“ this he aſcended into heaven, and left us in that ſtate of -juvenility in 
„which you behold us, and our ſons, then young, are the old deerepit 

« perſons you now ſee.” Joceline goes on to relate, that with this ſtaff 
our Apoſtle collected every venomous creature in the ifland to the top of 


the mountain of Cruagh Phadruig, in the county of Mayo, and from ende | 


precipitated them into the ocean. 

| Theſe tales were traditional among the Iriſh from the y ages ane. 
antecedent to the time of Joceline, who wrote A. D. 1185, for we find 

them in Henry the monk of Saltrey, who flouriſhed about forty years before 

that period. Superſtition, thus finding an eaſy aſſent from the credulity of 

mankind, wonderfully exalted the power of, and excited the veneration due 


to, ſuch reliques, ſo that we need not wonder at the notice taken of them | 


in the records of this church. But to return to our annals.

the damage done to the prior and canons was yery great : many Haters 
were left ſcarcely legible, and particularly a foundation charter of King 
Henry II. which could not by any means be read; the prior applied to the 
Barons of the Exchequer to enroll ſuch of their deeds as were not — de- 
ſtroyed, and leave was accordingly given. (o)

tavern, a leaſe to Begge of the manor of Dromſallen, in the county of 
Louth, for the term of 16 years, at the yearly rent of four marcs, the 
value of which manor was eſtimated at 10l. per annum, herthyields, cuf- 
toms, tithes, and other profits not included; and the ſaid Begge and his 
wife had enjoyed the ſame for ten years. It was enacted by parliament, 
11th and 12th King Edward IV. that the prior of the Holy Trinity might 
repoſſeſs himſelf of the ſaid manor, as the aforeſaid leaſe was made by

founded (u) an abbey, for nuns following the rule of St. Auguſtin, 
in a village called Hogges (w), adjoining the eaſt end of the city of Dub- 
lin, and near the preſent church of St. Andrew. Gregory, the archbiſh- 
op, and Malachy primate of Armagh, were directors of the building, 
and generous benefactors to it (x). In the year 1151, King Dermot, 


the founder, ſubjected the cell of Kilclehin, in the county of Kilkenny, 


and that of Athaddy, in the county of Carlow, to this houſe. (y) 


Sometime after the arrival of the Engliſh in this kingdom, a plot was 
formed againſt them by the natives; on this occaſion the nuns preſerved 

many of the Engliſh by ſecreting them in this abbey z which exemplary act 
of humanity gained them ſuch eſtimation in the eyes of King John, that, 
on his coming to Ireland, he rebuilt their Runder, and annexed many 
chapels and livings to it. (z) 

The lady abbeſs, Matilda, died 750 of March, but the year is uncer- 
tain (a). Roſſia was abbeſs; on her death a licence was granted to them, 
dated April gth, 1277, to proceed to an election (b). Sir Robert Bag- 
got, who founded an houſe for White Friars in the ſouth ſuburbs of the 
city, granted to this nunnery three acres of arable land in the tenement of 
Baggotrath (c), near to the town, in exchange for a meſſuage and a cur- 
tilage in the ſuburbs of Dublin, which did belong to the ſaid nunnery, 
yielding to him and his heirs a pair of gloves, or three-pence, in licu of 


all ſervices (d). In 15 31, this abbey paid one e ann, to the arch- 


biſhop (e).

December 1ſt, 6th King Edward VI. this monaſtery, with its appur- 


tenances, in the town of Ragarth, alias Regarthe, in the county of Dub-

It is ſuppoſed that the Knights Templars had a priory in a place called

the perſon called Lambert Simnell, being ſupported by divers of the nobi- 


lity, was crowned King in the priory of the Holy Trinity, by the name of 


Edward; the crown made uſe of on this occaſion was borrowed from the 
ſtatue of the Bleſſed Virgin, which ſtood in the church of this nunnery (1) ; : 
but on the 21ſt and 3oth days of July; in the ſame year, Gerald, Earl of 


Kildare, and many of the principal men in the kingdom, took the oaths of 


fidelity and allegiance. to the King in this church, before Sir Richard 


Edgecombe; the Earl at the ſame time preſenting his certificate, on oath, 
under the ſeal of his arms, as the bond of his future allegiance, and Sir 


Richard delivered to him the King's pardon under the great ſeal. (m) 
George Browne, who was archbiſhop from the year 1535 to 1554, 
united this church to that of St. Werburgh. (n)

King Henry II. having granted the city of Dublin to a colony from

Tus MonasTzRv or y WITESCHAN.. 


In an inquilition, concerning the bounds of the franchife of che City, 
taken in the reign of King Richard II. we meet with the following flight 
mention of this monaſtery : In the weſt part of Dublin, paſſing from the 
cc cathedral of St. Patrick through the Coombe, to the pool of the houſe 
66 of St. Thomas the martyr, leaving the South gate of the monaſtery of 
<« Miteſchan, and the Conelan towards the North, on the left hand.“ 
We can find no other account of this monaſtery. 

Among the pleas of the crown in Birmingham Tower, 3d King Edward 
II. we find on record, that Thomas Thonnyr was indicted for harbouring 
Adam, the ſon of Robert Cauntelon, who, with other malefaQors, bur- 
glariouſly entered the church of the friars de pænitentia Jeſu Chriſti, and 
robbed them of the ſum of forty ſhillings (p); probably this houſe de 
pænitentia may be that of Witeſchan. The friars de pænitentia had alſo 
the name of the Sac Friars; their commencement was in the year 1245 
their appearance in England was firſt at Cambridge, A. D. 1258, and 
their arrival in Ireland was in 1268 (q). This order was not however of 
long duration, it was condemned in England in 1307, and the houſes 
belonging to it, paſſed into other fraternities, or private hands; we alſo 
find that the council of Vienne, in 1311, condemned the order every 
where (r). This may well account for all memorials of the monaſtery of 
Witeſchan being loſt. 


THE Priory or ALL-HALLOwS, oR ALL-SAINTS. 


A. D. 1166. This priory was ſituated on Hoggin- green, now called 
College- green, and was founded about the year 1166, for canons of the 
order of Aroaſia, by Diarmit, the ſon of Murchard King of Leinſter; for 
their uſe, he granted to his confeſſor Edan, biſhop of Louth, or Clogher, 
the land of Ballidubgail (s), with the farmers on the land, viz. Meliſſa

that, which is now called the old bridge, and compleated it in the year 
1428. A lay-brother of the order conſtantly attended to receive a toll for 
every carriage, or beaſt, paſſing the ſame. Doctor Bourk, in his Hiſtoria 


Dominicana, ſays, that he remembers to have ſeen, when a boy (probably 


about the time of the revolution) the veſſel which held the holy water with 
which every paſſenger was ſprinkled. (u) 
1459. It was enacted by parliament, that this monaſtery ſhould, in 


future, have 10l. annually in frank almoin, for the repairs of their 


houſe (w); and this ſtatute was confirmed in perpetuity 7 an act of the

1467. An act paſſed this year, the 7th of the ſame Kine, declaring all 
grants paſſed by the King, or by King Henry VI. to be null and void; 


but not to be prejudicial to the friars of this houſe, reſpecting a grant of 


ten marcs annually, paſſed to 8 out of the fee farm of the city of 
Dublin. (x) kD. 

1474. Thomas Kelly was prior; ten marcs yearly were granted to him,

of the 14th of King Edward IV. relating to certain grants made to the 
city of Dublin out of the ſaid fee farm.

Tas CARMELITE MoNASTERY, OR Wire FrIARs 3 


In the year 1278, the Carmelite friars repreſented to the King, Edward 
I. that by ſeveral grants of Roger Oweyne,, James de Bermingham, and 
Nicholas Bacuir, they had procured an habitation for themſelves with cer- 
tain tenements and other poſſeſſions within the city of Dublin, and that they 


propoſed to erect a church thereon; the King therefore, by his writ, dated 


November 6th, commands the bailiffs and citizens of Dublin to permit the 
friars to inhabit the ſaid place, and to build their church, without let or 
impediment. The citizens obſtinately oppoſed the friars, and ſhewed the 
many inconveniencies that would accrue from allowing their petition (e). 


The Carmelites being thus. foiled, applied themſelves, with more 


ſucceſs, to Sir Robert Bagot, Knight, Chief Juſtice of the King's Bench, 
who built a monaſtery for them, in the pariſh of St. Peter, in the ſouth 
ſuburbs of the city, on a lot of ground which he purchaſed from the abbey 
of Baltinglaſs, in the county of Wicklow. (f) 

A. D. 1320. This year, John Sugdacus, provincial of the Carmelite: 
friars in Ireland, held a chapter of the order here; as did David O'Buge, 
in a ſhort time after. g) 

1333. The parliament fat in the hall of this monaſtery, June 11th this 
year; and on one of their adjournments, as they were going out of the court: 
yard of the houſe, Murchard, the ſon of Nicholas O' Lothill, was ſuddenly, 
ſtabbed in the croud, and the murderer eſcaped unknown. (h) 


1335. The King, Edward III. granted, June 1oth, a yearly penſion of 


100 ſhillings for the ſupport of a chantry in the treaſury, Dublin. (i) 
1351. Robert Serle was provincial of the order. (

1383. Stephen Drake the prior dying, the temporalities belonging to COUN TY 


the priory were ſeized into the King's hands, as if an anceſtor of the King DUBLIN, 


had really been the founder of the priory 5 but it being proved by John 
Randolph, the newly elected prior, that their founder was er * ng 
of Murchard, the temporalities were reſtored. (a) N 

1393. John Kendall was prior. And the ſame year, adde Tueſday next 
before the feaſt of St. Patrick, Richard Lynch, with ſundry other perſons, 
aſſaulted the ſaid prior, turned him out of his houſe, and impriſoned him 
at Ballyghe; they then made a caſtle of the priory, and by foree of arms 
kept poſſeſſion thereof againſt the prior till the Thurſday next after the feaſt 
of St. Patrick; being indicted for the ſame, Lynch was acquitted. (b) 

1476. A dense was granted to the prior, James Cogan, and his ſuc- 
ceſſors to acquire lands for the uſe of the Priory, to the yalue of 4ol, 
yearly, notwithſtanding the ſtatute of mortmain. (c) 
1484. The ploughland of Ballygoſſan, alias Cabrah-hill, hardy been 
obtained for this priory by John, achbiſhop of Dublin (but what John is 
uncertain, though it is not improbable that it was John de Saunford, 
who ſtood high in the favour of King Edward I.), he reſerved to himſelf 
and his ſucceſſors an annuity of two marcs,” which annuity afterwards oc- 
cafioned great diſputes at law between the archbiſhops and the priory ; but 
' archbiſhop Walton, with the conſent of his two chapters, did, by a charter 
dated May 1ſt, 1484, releaſe all right and title to the ſaid annuity and 


lands, reſerving in lieu thereof to him and his ſucceſſors, three pounds of 


wax annually, and appointed the annuity to be diſtributed, 58. to the 
ſub- prior, and the remainder to the canons; and further ordered, that the 
faid convent ſhould keep yearly an anniverſary for the archbiſhop and his 
| ſucceſſors, on the morrow of All-Souls, by ſinging a placebo and dirige. 
The archbiſhop certainly acted properly in reſtoring this annuity to the pri- 
ory, for as the lands were the charitable gift of the crown, the archbiſhop 
John had no right to reſerve any annuity out of them. (dj 


1488. The prior, James Cogan, took the oaths of allegiance before 


Sir Richard Edgecombe, who was ſent to Ireland this year to adminiſter 
the ſame to the principal nobility and great officers, on the ſettlement of 
the kingdom aſter the Caſturbances occaſioned . 5 the — of nen

Nothing could ſo well ſait the taſte of an age tinctured with all the ele- 
vating: ſpirit of romance, and heightened by every ſpecies of religious 
n as the inſtitution of the order of the Knights Templars about 
the year 1118. The Chriſtian world was ſo highly pleaſed with — un- 
exampled goodneſs of their firſt profeſſots, that in the ſpace of 126 years, 
from the: fiſt inſtitution of the Knights Templars, they were — d of 
à no leſs number than gooo manors in Chriſtendom, and at the time when 
it was determined to put à period to their exiſtence, they were in actual poſ- 
feſſion of 16,000 lordſhips. A Prince fo jealous of his prerogative, and 
naturally ſo avaricious, as Philip King of France, beheld the riſing greatnefs 
of theſe Knights with an envious and malignant eye. The blackneſs of the 
accuſation brought againſt them, at firſt! awakened the attention of the 
public, and then raiſed their deteſtation. Their luxury, their intempe- 
rance, and impurity, cannot, even at this diſtance of time, be denied, 
but thoſe crimes were indeed too general in that age, to bear ſo peculiar- 
ly hard againſt the unfortunate Templars. The people; however, were 
ſtruck with horror at an accumulated charge now brought againſt

idolatry; a charge ſo groſs as almoſt to ſurpaſs human belief. It was

Princes were dike favourcd' 'by the Pope, the charge brobght agaroſt the 
Templars in France was held in England as cohfeſfed, and it was publicly 
ordained. by the King and his Couticil; that all 6f that rde throu ghout his 
dornifiietis ſhould be ſeized (k). This coilimitis was darriet into — 
execution; and the trial bf the Templars was conducted wich great fold: 
nity in the city of Dublin, before friar Richard Balybyn, miniſter of the 
order of the D6ininicaris in Ireland, friat Philip de Slane, Ie@urer of the 
fate, atid friar Hügh St. Eeger. Artiongſt other witnee! againſt the 
Knights were Roger de Hetofl, guarckian of the Franciſcan friars, 

Walter de Prendergaſf, their leckurer, Thomas; the abbot; Sithon, 

prior of the abbey of St. Thomas the martyr" and Roger, ofi6f of che 
Auguſtinian friary in Ditblin. The depoſitions againſt the Templars were 
weakly ſupported, yet they were condemned; but more indeed throng zh 


plind compliance with the prevailing practice türodghout the other parts ef 
Europe, than any demerits bein 8p agen their petſons. Their lands

In England many of the Knights Tetoplats Weie cbitürked to' Bols

lowance to each 6f fotir-perice,. and to the grand lifter two millings; 


ſeveral of the captains the King towed fer- hene a day, as the Knights 1 
did formerly, fot their diet, and twenty ſhillings yearly for their ſtipend 


or livery; to their ſervants he gave tw6-pefice à day, and to inferior ſer- 
for their livery ; and for this- 


allowance they were to perform the ſame ſervices which they had before done

It is more than probable that the King s ſervants in this kingdom Pur-

1474. In the 14th year of King Edward IV. it was enacted, that 
Doctor Marcellus, a foreigner from Rome, for creating frequent diſtur- 
bances among the clergy, ſhould depart this land within one month, never 
to return, and if he ſhould be found in this kingdom after the expiration of 
the ſaid month, that then it ſhould be lawful for any perſon whatſoever to ap- 
prehend the ſaid Marcellus as an enemy or traitor, and whoever ſhould en- 
tertain or receive him, that perſon ſhould be adjudged a felon and traitor ; 
all fees and penſions granted to the doctor before the ſaid time to be null and

void and of none effet, and no pardon whatſoever ſhould be available to 
him unleſs by expreſs authority of parliament. This act, however, not to 
be prejudicial to this hopital. But the prior having ſheltered Marcellus, an 
act was made the enſuing year, 1 5th Edward IV. enforcing the aforeſaid - 
act, and further, that the prior and hoſpital ſhould forfeit their nene, 
if they entertained him above two months. (x) 

The prior, James Keating, having been conſtable of the Caſtle of 


Dublin, he fortified it with men at arms againſt Henry Lord Grey, then De- 


puty Lieutenant of Ireland, and broke down the bridge thereof; in. a parlia-

the ſaid James ſhould cauſe the faid bridge to be ſubſtantially and ſufficiently 
repaired before the Chriſtmas following, agreeable to the ſurvey of Henry 
White of Dublin, clerk ; and that if the ſaid bridge was not repaired within 
the time aforeſaid, that then his office of prior ſhould be void, and it ſhould be 
lawful for the Lord Deputy to appoint a guardian or cuſtodee of the ſaid 
priory, until the grand maſter of Rhodes, or the prior of St. John in Lon- 
don ſhould provide a guardian or prior for the hoſpital ſy). Keating, 
however, (as is ſuppoſed) made up this breach, for on the roth of Fe-

1479. Theprior Keating was this year one of the enen ſociety of 
St. George, Dublin. (b) 
1482. In the month of December, Keating was deprived of his dignie y 
by Peter Daubuſſon, grand maſter of Rhodes, for diſobedience 
and mal-adminiſtration, particularly for ſelling and pawning divers of the 
jewels belonging to the hoſpital, amongſt which was a piece of the 
holy croſs; that he had ſold and diſpoſed of ſeveral of their farms, made 
long leafes of others, and charged them with divers annual penſions ; the 
grand Maſter appointed Marmaduke Lomley, of a noble Engliſh family, 
to ſucceed Keating, The next year Lomley landed at Clontarf, a com- 
mandery of the order, near Dublin ; as ſoon as Keating had notice of his 
arrival, he haſtened thither, attended by a body of armed men, took 
Lomley priſoner, and kept him in cloſe confinement till he had reſigned into 
his (Keating's) hands all the inſtruments of his election and confirmation, 
although Lomley had made a previous proteſt againſt it. Keating at | 
length aſſigned to him the commandery of Kilfaran in the county of Lowth = 
for his maintenance. An account of theſe violent proceedings was tranſ- 1 
mitted to the King (Henry VI.) and alſo to the grand maſter ; and after a 8 
tedious delay, Keating was excommunicated ; enraged ee he by „ 
force expelled Lomley out of Kilſaran, and threw him again into priſon, 
accuſing him as the ſole cauſe of theſe new troubles ; the archbiſhop of 
Armagh ſtrenuouſly, but vainly, endeavoured to liberate him. The fate of IM 
the unfortunate Lomley is not certainly known; but in an act of the 1oth —_—_—_ 
of King Henry VII. we are told that he died of a broken heart. The tur- 1 c 
bulent ſpirit of Keating would not reſt here; as he had hitherto ſucceeded 220 
ſo proſperouſly, he ſuppoſed that he could not only depoſe but 'even make i 
kings at his pleafure ; he therefore heartily joined in the ſcheme of raiſing 3 
the perſon, called Lambert Simnell to the throne of England; but hap- = 
pily his hopes were fruſtrated. | 108 
1488. Sir Richard Edgecombe v was ſent hither with full powers to ſettle __ 
matters, and to conciliate the minds of the people to the eſtabliſhed go- 1 
vernment. Powerful interceſſion was made for Keating, but the many 
crimes alledged againſt him, joined to diſloyalty, overcame all ſo-

DUSLIN. moved bim from the office of conſtable. of the Caſtle of Dublin, which 
be had uſurped from Richard Archbold, and retained for ſeveral 


years; on the removal of Keating, Archbald was replaced in his old com- 
mand (e); and Keating, but for his hahit, would have been very roughly 
handled ; he however kept forcible poſſeſſion of the hoſpital till about the 


year 1491, when he was at length ejeced with great diſgrace, and ended 


bis factious life, as is ſuppoſed, in the moſt abject poverty and contempt, 
but not till he had ſcen James Vall or Wall, ſubſtituted in his room. (d) 
1494. It was enacted by parliament that whoever was made prior of this 
hoſpital by the grand maſter of Rhodes, or by his deputy, with the Kings 
aſſent, ſhould be a man born in England, wiſe and diſcreet, and having 
ſuch a connexion with the knights of the order in England, as that his Ma. 
jeſtty force N be occaſionally 95 more mn here, by his 
means. (e) 

Another act paſſed the fame year, at ribs Cpricinita of Sir John Ken- 
dall, prior of St. John of Jeruſalem, within the realm of England, import- 
ing that, “ whereas Sir James Keating, late prior of Kilmainham, and Sir 
Thomas Talbet, his predeceſſor, have alienated and granted in fees and 
annuities, under their conventual feal, the moſt part of the lordſhips of the 
ſaid priory, and have granted leafes and farms thereof for lives, years, and 
in fee ; and whereas ſeveral lords and gentlemen have entered into divers of 
the poſſeſſions of the faid priory, and forcibly keep poſſeſſion of the ſame; it 
is enacted, that all ſuch alienations and grants made by the faid Keating, 
or any of his predeceſſors, ſhall be reſumed, revoked, and made void; 
and that whoever ſhall be made prior by the maſter of Rhodes, with the 
King's conſent, ſhall enter into the faid/priory, and amd into ſuch lanGs and 
poſſeſſions as were forcibly kept from the ſaid priory. . 

It was enaQed in the ſame year, that all perſons whih mould bave in 
their cuſtody any relique of the holy croſs, or any other relique, jewel, 
or ornament belonging to the priory of Kilmainham, pledged by prior 
Keating, ſhould reſtore and deliver the ſame to the preſent priorhe pay- 
ing the money for which the ſaid reliques were pledged or fold. 

Another act paſſed the ſame year, which deprived all ſuch perſons as 
were preferred to commanderies by prior Keating. . 

1496. Sir Richard Talbot, Knight, was prior this year (g), but he was

diſplaced in the year 1498 by the grand maſter, who appointed Robert Evers, COUN TY 


an Engliſhman, prior in his room; Evers was however removed by the ſame 


authority in 1511, when the preceptory of Slebach, in Pembrokeſhire, was 


aſſigned to him for his ſupport ; and Sir John Rawſon, another Engliſh- 


man, ſucceeded to the priorſhip (h). In the King's letter, dated June the 


16th, 1512, is the following citation: —“ That Sir John Rawſon, being 
whe ſorely viſited with ſickneſs, did enter by his proctors into the ſaid priory, 

« yet the treaſurer, &c. by a jury, have found the ſaid prior to be abſent 
“ without the King's leave; now the King commands an amoveas manum, 
« and that the ſaid Sir John may enter peaceably therein, and alſo that he 
bs admitted of the privy council.“ (1) _ 

1528, In Chriſtmas, the Lord Deputy was entertained by the ſeveral 
priors of Kilmainham, Chriſt Church, and All Saints, with the exhibition 
of ſtage plays. See Chriſt Church. 


Sir John Rawſon was Lord Treaſurer of Ireland in the years 1 $12... 


1530, 1531, and to the 5th of July 1532. K) 

This priory paid, in 1531, 61. es. 8d. proxies to the archbiſhop. (1) 
1535. About the end of the month of December, the Lord Deputy, 
William Skeffington, died in this hoſpital. (mz 


By an inquiſition taken at Dublin 2oth March, 33d King Henry VIII. 


it was found, that Sir John Rawſon, prior of this houſe, had, on the 22d 
day of November, with the aſſent of his chapter, under their common 


ſeal, ſurrendered the ſame to the King, with the church, &c. of the ſaid 


hoſpital, and all their poſſeſſions, viz. Kilbride, in the county of Dublin, 


near the Three Caſtles, with the court, leet, frank pledge to the ſame 


belonging, and 200 great acres of mountain, 100 of arable, meadow, and 
moor, and 200 of paſture and mountain, now waſte and of no valug. (n) 


Sir John Rawſon, on the 2oth of June, 1541, was created Viſcount of. 


Clontarf, with a penſion of 500 marcs out of the eſtate of the hoſpital (o). 
He had a daughter named Catharine, who was married to Rowland, ſon 


of Patrick Whyte ſecond baron of the Exchequer. (p) 
1545. March the 8th, the archbiſſiop obtained a licence from the crown 


"” unite the church of St. John the Baptiſt of Kilmainham, and that of 


St. James to the church of St. Catharine in the ſuburbs. (q)

COUNTY Cardinal Pole, the Pope's legate, reſtored to his former poſſeſſions ; and 
riot was confirmed therein by Queen Mary, under the great ſeal, on the 8th of 
| March. At the ſame time, Sir Oſwald Maſlingberd, or Maſſyngberte, 

was made prior (r) ; but on the acceſſion of Queen Elizabeth, he private- 
ly withdrew from the kingdom, and died in obſcurity. (s) | | 

The prior of this hoſjital always ſat as a baron in the houſe of Lads: (t) 
he priory was itſelf ſo ſpacious, and the ſtructure ſo uncommonly ele. 
gant, that at the general diffolutioa it was eſteemed one of the beſt build. 
ings throughout the kingdom (u); ; and for ſome time before its fall, the 
Lords Deputies ufually reſided in it during the ſummer ſeaſon. (w) 

By an inquiſition, taken 32d King Henry VIII. this hoſpital had three 
gardens and an orchard within the walls, four towers erected on the walls,

St. Carthag in his monaſtery of Rathenen. A. D. 571, or 572, he 
placed St. Cronan over the church of Cluain-Dachrann, near Rathe- 
nen ; he was afterwards a monk of Liſmore, and was probably abbot 
Were ? on quitting which, he preſided over the monaſtery of Glaſſ- 
more; where, on the 1oth of February, he was inhumanly butchered, to- 


8 with all his monks, by a party of Daniſh pirates, who landed at 
Inbher-domhnann, a port in the eaſt part of Leinſter, and not far from Dub- 


lin; the year in which this uncompaſſionate act was perpetrated, is uncer- 
tain, but we are told that St. Cronan was living about the year 631, or 636. 
Ibe above account ſtrongly evinces, that Glaſſmore was ſituated near to 
Swords; and, as a further proof of this, the Calendarium Caſſelenſe tells 
us, that St. Cronan reſts near Swords, Surdum Sti. Columbani (e). From 


hence we may, with ſome probability, infer, that the ſite of the ancient 


Glaſſmore, and the preſent Moortown, are the lame ; the latter is lituated 
about a mile from Swords. if 1. 


MOUNTOWN; 


++: hf Monkſtown, near Dunleary, in the half barony of Rathdown, and 
about five miles from Dublin. Jones, in his life of St. Patrick, places a 
Ciſtertian friary here ; but he 1s certainly miſtaken, for it was unqueſtion- 
ably only a grange belonging to the priory of the Holy Trinity, Dublin. 


PALMERSTOWN; 


Situated on the river Liffey, three miles weſt from Dublin, and in the 


barony of Newcaſtle. _ 
Richard, who was prior of the houſe of St. Laurence, near Dublin, 


ſued Reginald de Bernevalle, and Joan his mother, for a freehold in Tyr- 


newer, which they had taken poſſeſſion of contrary to law; and a writ was 


iſſued to the Sheriff to produce their bodies in court. (d) 


A. D. 1427. King Henry VI. granted the cuſtody of the Leper's houſe, 


near Palmerſtown, to John Waile, to hold the ſame with all the meſſuages, 
lands, and tenements thereunto belonging, ſo long as the ſame ſhould 
- continue in. the King's hands, at the yearly rent of three ſhillings. (e)

1387. On the Saturday before the feſtival of St. Patrick, in this year, : 


John, the ſon of Gilbert Lawleſs, and his ſervant John Brown, turned 
out of the earth by the plough, in a field near Hogthorne, between the vil- 


lages of Rathcoole and Taſſagard, a ring of pure gold, of the value or 
eſtimation of forty pounds ſterling, which they ſecreted ; but the conceal- 
ment being diſcovered, they were preſented for the Side; and on being 
aſked, what they had to offer by way of defence, in reſpect to the ſaid 


ring, and why they ſhould not make ſatisfaction to the King for the value 
of the ſame, they pleaded, that his Majeſty, out of his eſpecial grace, had 


pardoned the tranſgreſſion and alſo the concealment. (i) 80 
Taſſagard, commonly called Saggard, is now a pariſh church, but in ruins. 


ST. CATHARINE's;,

ſeveral parcels of land adjoining thereto, with liberty to the ſaid canons 
to build a mill on the river, and to make a mill-pool whenever they ſhould 
ſee convenient. He further granted to them the church of the Bleſſed

John Warriſius was prior, and their patron, who was Lord of Lucan, 
enfeoffed him, with a mefſuage and a carrucate of land in Lucan, enjoin- 
ing him, out of the produce thereof, to find ſix chaplains to celebrate 
divine offices for ever, in the priory of St. Catharine, for the ſouls of all 
his progenitors ; and he farther enfeoffed the ſaid prior and chaplains, with 
the motety of a mill upon the river Liffey. Adam de Hereford, Knight, 
Lord of Leixlip, did alſo enfeoff the faid prior, with a carrucate of land, 
in the lordſhip of Leixlip, for the purpoſe of finding ſix chaplains in the 
priory of St. Catherine, in like manner as Warriſius had done. Richard 
Shirman 1s named as prior, 1n this deed, which 1 Is dated between the years 

1218, and 1224. 85 
1323. Richard Turnour was prior; in whoſe time this priory fell into ſo 


great poverty, and was fo oppreſſed with debts that they were not able to 


fupport themſelves, the King therefore granted his licenſe to the ſaid prior, 
to enable him to aſſign and make over to Stephen Tyrrell, abbot of the 
houſe of St. Thomas, in Dublin, the ſaid priory, with all its lands and 
poſſeſſions; and William de Haſtend, deſcended from Warriſius, the firſt 
founder, confirmed this aſſignment. Witneſſes, Alexander, archbiſhop 
of Dublin, William Rodier, dean of St. Patrick's, Dublin, William de

near the top, and oppoſite to the cardinal points; the door is nine feet 


from the ground; the inſide of the building is nearly as ſmooth as the 
barrel of a gun, and on the outſide, at the baſe, a circle of ſtone projects 
five inches. The church, which is the moſt eaſterly building, was large 
and beautiful, with a noble carved window over the high-altar ; next to 


this u indow, to the right, about ten feet from the ground, is the follow-

Round this inſcription is a frame, ſomewhat raiſed, with another inſcrip- 
tion on it, which is now illegible. 

Next to the tower is a vaulted building of hewn ſtone, which ends in

chonnaght Maguire, entered into articles with Cuchonnaght Fitz-Cu- 
chonnaght Maguire, Lord of the country of Fermanagh, to reſtore it to 
its priſtine ſtate. Maguire being grieved at ſeeing the church, which he 
and the principal people of the country had choſen for the place of their 


| ſepulture, ſo nearly demoliſhed, requeſted the before-mentioned lord ab- 


bot to ſurrender his title, and ſuffer him to provide another order for 
the houſe, who ſhould Keep it in proper repair, and engage that there 
ſhould be conſtantly divine ſervice therein. The abbot, together with the 
biſhop and chapter, entered into an agreement which received the confir- 


mation of the Pope, who ordered the Franciſcan friars to take poſſeſſion of 


the abbey ; and the Lord Maguire made a recompence to the abbot Cahill, 
of ten dry cows yearly, to him and his lineal heirs for ever.. In this deed, 

a fine was ordered of cows to the O'Hofics and M Crifferties, the 
poets, who were to reprove, infame and reprehend, in their ſatirick writ- 
ings, every diſturber of the friars, otherwiſe the ordinary fine of 20 cows 


| was to be levied out of their own proper goods and lands. At the perfect- 


ing of this deed, Turlogh O'Neill Lord of Tyrone, Hugh Mc'Manus. 
O Donnell Lord of Tirconnell, Cuchonnaght Maguire Lord of Ferma- 
nanagh, Brian Me' Brian O. Roirk Lord of the Breiny, and Daniel 
Mc'Taig O Conor Lord of Lower Conaght, were preſent, as alſo Con- 
nor Mc'Cardell, Biſhop of Clogher, and Owyn O*Duffie, Miniſter Pro- 
vinciat. Maguire afterwards began to rebuild the abbey in a moſt agreeable 
and eligible ſituation ; but before the completion of the building, the de- 
ſtroying powers of King Henry VIII. overwhelmed it in the year 1530. (s)

ſervice being totally neglected therein, the abbot Cahill Mc'Brian, Mc'Cu- 
chonnaght Maguire, entered into articles with Cuchonnaght Fitz-Cu- 


1 chonnaght Maguire, Lord of the country of Fermanagh, to reſtore it to 


its priſtine ſtate. Maguire being grieved at ſeeing the church, which he 
and the principal people of the country had choſen for the place of their 
ſepulture, ſo nearly demoliſhed, requeſted the before- mentioned lord ab- 
bot to ſurrender his title, and ſuffer him to provide another order for 
the houſe, who ſhould Keep it in proper repair, and engage that there 
ſhould be conſtantly divine ſervice therein. The abbot, together with the 
biſhop and chapter, entered into an agreement which received the confir- 
mation of the Pope, who ordered the Franciſcan friars to take poſſeſſion of 
the abbey ; and the Lord Maguire made a recompence to the abbot Cahill, 
of ten dry cows Je, t to him and his lineal heirs for ever. In this deed, 
a fine was ordered of cows to the O'Hofies and M Crifferties, the 
poets, who were to reprove, infame and reprehend, in their ſatirick writ-. 
ings, every diſturber of the friars, otherwiſe the ordinary fine of 20 cows 
was to be levied out of their own proper goods and lands. At the perfect- 
ing of this deed, Turlogh O'Neill Lord of Tyrone, Hugh Mc' Manus 
O*Donnell Lord of Tirconnell, Cuchonnaght Maguire Lord of Ferma- 


nanagh, Brian Mc' Brian O- Roirk Lord of the Breiny, and Daniel 


Mc'Taig O Conor Lord of Lower Conaght, were preſent, as alſo Con- 
nor Mc'Cardell, Biſhop of Clogher, and Owyn O*Duffie, Miniſter. Pro- 
vincial. Maguire afterwards began to rebuild the abbey in a moſt agreeable 
and eligible ſituation ; but before the completion of the building, the de- 
ſtroying powers of King Henry VIII. overwhelmed it in the year 1530. (s) 
By ſeveral inquiſitions, it appears that this abbey was poſſeſſed of Drum- 


cion, two tates; Gortret, one tate; Colkie, three tates; Grangeth, three 


tates ; Liſredy, two tates; Cappoge, one tate; Lanchall, two tates ; 
Drumkeen, two tates; Moyleat, four tates; all of the ancient meaſure,

Meyler de Britz dal, the ſecond baron of Athenry, gave to the 
Dominican friars 160 marcs to aſſiſt in building this houſe, and granted the 
land whereon to erect it; he alſo preſented to them (on the completion 
of the building, as we ſuppoſe) an hogſhead of wine. De Bermingham 
was induced to begin this work by letters from St. Dominick, and a noble 


| monaſtery was erected here, under the invocation of St. Peter and St. Paul, 


in the year 1241. 
A. D. 1242. A general chapter of the order was held here. / w)

moved from thence and interred in this friary. (x)

houſe for ſcholars in this friary, and * many exemplary rules for 


the practice of the friars. (y) 


1263. Thomas O' Kelly, biſhop of Clonfert, was interred in this 


church; he built the vault near the north fide of the high altar, whither 
he cauſed all the ſcattered bones to be removed ; the biſhop. was a liberal 
benefactor to this friary, excluſive of ſo particular an inſtance. (z)

liam, archbiſhop of Tuam, the ſon of their founder; it is ſuppoſed, that 
the friars laid a claim to be exempt from his viſitation, on which the arch- 
biſhop behaved with a violence unbecoming his ſacred character and dig- 
nity, but the end of the conteſt is not known. (b)

It cannot be the King of Conaught of that name, for he died in the year 
1224, ſeventeen years before the foundation of the convent. (o) 

This friary continued for many years the cemitery of the Cy family, 
and is at preſent that of many families of the firſt rank. 

Here follows a rent roll of the poſſeſſions of this houſe. 

In Athenry a piece of ground walled in, containing a large and excel. 
tent mill, at the very gate of the convent, and ſeveral houſes ; without 
the town, the village of Gluaimhean Bhauin, which did formerly belong 
to the Benedictines; another very extenſive field near the town. to the 
ſouth, called the Foreſt of the Brethren ; at the north ſide a field, called 
Balle Dhay, where 1s a chapel belonging to the convent ; a mile from the 
town, to the north eaſt, is another farm, called Bingbarra ; the cell of 
Kilcorban, with a good farm ; in the pariſh of Grainſeagh, between Bin- 
mor. and Rathglaſs, is a large and fertile village, called ROE 
madh-lubain an teampuill, together with a chapel. (q) 

The ruins which remain of this friary, prove it to have been a ſumptuous 
building ; part of it was taken down to ere& in its room the preſent bar- 
racks, and the cloiſters probably ſtood wh the barrack- yard is now; 
the whole was well built of a. blue colo ſtone; the tower, for half 
its height, is. larger below than above. The great eaſt window is bold 
and of good workmanſhip; there were here numbers of mauſoleums, but 
the ſoldiers have eraſed them. all, and with their N r the wa ah is 


nearly covered.

here. (r) 


1309. William de Briſtol was prior, when he brought 'before Sir Jolm

taking from the friars of this convent, the corpſe of John de Cantelupe, 


and burying it elſewhere; ; and alſo for beating and other wiſe illuſing ſun- 


dry friars of this houſe; the biſhop at the ſame time prohibiting all per- 
ſons, under pain of excommunication, from furniſhing the friars with any 
neceſſaries, either through charity or otherwiſe. The biſhop and his 


chapter were hereupon arreſted, their goods and chattles aiſtrained, and 
the money ariſing from the ſame was ordered to be paid into the hands of 
the Lord Juſtice on the next ſucceeding wy after the feaſt of St. Peter ad 


vincula. (s) 


Several of the Lords of Kerry, and many of their reſpective families, | 


were interred here, among which we find the following :—Nicholas, who 
died in the year 1324; Maurice in 1339 (t); Deſideria, daughter of Ger- 
rald Fitz Maurice, was a liberal benefactreſs to this houſe, and died on the 


feaſt of St. John the Evangeliſt, A. D. 1345 (u); John died in the year 
1348, Maurice in 1398, Patrick in 1410, Thomas in 1469, Edmund in 
1498, and another Edmund who took on him the habit of the order, 


and died in the year 1543. ( 
- This priory was in high eſtimation, on account of numerous e 


which were ſaid to have been wrought there. (ww) 


The ruins of this noble ſtructure ſtand a little to the des of the 


town ; the walk of the ſteeple, the choir with ſome of the cloiſters, the 
dormitory, and the chapel for morning prayer, remain entire (x). In the

1180. This abbey, ſays our annaliſt, being ever eſteemed a paradiſe, 
and a ſecure ſanctuary, the treaſure and moſt valuable effects of the 
whole country were depoſited in the hands of its clergy ; notwithſtanding 
which, we find the abbey was plundered in this year by Maolduin, ſon of 
Daniel O*'Donaghoe, many of the clergy were ſlain, and even in their cemi- 
tery, by the M*Carthy's ; but God ſoon puniſhed this act of impiety and 
ſacrilege, by bringing many of its authors to an untimely end. O 

1191. Died the abbot MMugy. (Kk)

The ſame year, on the 19th of December, died Gilla Patrick O'Huiair,

piety, wiſdom, and univerſal charity. (m)

The remains of this abbey are very extenſive, and its ſituation is extreme- COUNTY 


ly pictureſque (s). A ſmall chapel ſtanding at ſome diſtance from the ab- 
bey, and which had originally belonged to it, is now converted by the 
noble proprietor into a banqueting houſe for the reception of viſitors to 
the romantic ſcenes of Killarney.

In the barony of Magunihy, and on the borders of Loughlean; Do- 


nald, ſon of Thady M' Carthy, in the year 1440, founded a friary here, 
under the invocation of the Holy Trinity, for Conventual Franciſcans; 
he repaired it in the year 1468, a few months before his deceaſe. (t) 
Irrelagh has continued ſince that time the cemitery of the M. Carthy 
family. And Donald, Earl of Clancare, was interred here; as was Patrick, 
Lord Kerry, the Earl's nephew, who died Auguſt 12th, anno 1600. (u) 
This abbey was re-ediftied by the Roman Catholicks in the year 1602, 
but was ſoon after permitted to go to ruin. It is ſurrounded by a vene- 
rable grove of very tall aſh-trees, which in ſome places grow ſpontaneouſly 
from the ruins. The choir, nave, and ſteeple, are yet entire, as are 
the cloiſters, which conſiſt of ſeveral Gothic arches all of ſolid mar- 
ble, encloſing a ſmall ſquare, in the centre of which ſtands a very tall 
yew-tree, whoſe ſpreading branches, overſhadowing and throwing a brown 
ſhade over the niches of the whole cloiſter, form a much more ſolemn 
and awful kind of covering than the original one. The ſteeple of this 
extenſive building is ſupported by a Gothic arch, which, from its ſize, 


could only contain one bell (w). A miraculous image of the Virgin Ma- 


ry was faid to have been preſerved here. 


This abbey with its poſſeſſions, containing four acres of land or there- 


abouts, two orchards, and one garden, valued at 16s. yearly, was grant- 
ed to Robert Collan. See the Abbey of Innisfallen. (x)

A Palonv OF Kibri ibis 


Was We here, under the invocation of the Virgin Mary, by Ge- 
offry de Mariſcis, in the reign of King John. The prior of this houſe 
was a lord of parliament ; but, on account of the very great diſtance be- 
tween his place of refidence and the metropolis, he was feldom ſum- 
moned (a). The walls of the church are of a great length, and ſtrong i in 

proportion; theſe, and a noble Gothic eaſt window, are yet entire. The 
architecture, which is of a dark marble, beſpeaks the ſtructure to be much 
more modern than the time before mentioned. Large poſſeſſions, ſituate 
in divers parts of the country, did belong to this houſe; which were 
granted for the term of twenty-one years to Thomas Clinton, at the an- 


nual rent of 171. and 21d. (b)

note; and in war- time the cireumjacent inhabitants were exempt from 


all the accuſtomary burdens of the country. In the centre of the circle 


was a ſtone croſs and two yew- trees, from one of which hung a bell. This 
houſe was in being in the year 1396, and a0th of the reign of King Ri- 
chard II. for about that time the prieſts belonging thereto procured for 
themſelves and their ſucceſſors certain. lands in perpetuity, without ob- 


taining the King's conſent, and contrary to the ſtatute of mortmain. 


John Lye of Rathbride, gentleman, being ſeized of divers lands in the 
ſaid townland of Clonagh, levelled the tenements, bounds and limits of 
the ſaid religious houſe, threw down and deſtroyed the croſs and trees, and 
erected a tower or ſmall caſtle, with other buildings; all theſe ſaid pre-

M'ONASTTC ON 


A. D. 1202. A priory was founded here under the invocation. of the 
Virgin Mary and St. David (d), by Meyler Fitz-Henry, whoſe father was . 
natural fon to King Henry I. he came into this kingdom with the firſt ad- 
venturers, young and in high eſteem for his perſonal-bravery and warlike ex- 
ploits'; he filled this houſe with regular canons from the monaſtery of 
Lanthony in Monmouthſhire, and dying in the year 1220, was interred in 


the chapter-houſe of this priory, with this epitaph-: 


Conduntur tumulo Meyleri nobilis oſſa, 
Indomitus domitor totius gentis Hiberniæ. 


Ol which the following very inclegant tranſlation has been given: 


Intombed are the bones of him they noble Meyler call, 
Who was the tameleſs tamer of the Iriſh nation all. (e) 


Friar Clynn, In his annals, places this foundation i in 1211. 

1205. King John, in the ſeventh year of his reign, confirmed the 
grants made by Meyler, viz. the town-lands of Tachenohea, Liſner- 
guith, Athcargr, Kellingan, Mullinkerly, Baletarſna, Bithelan, and 
Oluvartheda, with all their appurtenances; three carucates of land at 
Conall, viz. the moiety of Balibochel, which he had in exchange from 
Roger Gernun; and on the other fide of the water, a carucate which 
Stephen Carpenter had poſſeſſed, and a carucate in the vale of Dublin; 
Kilpool, with its appurtenances, and eight meaſe of herrings rent; five 
burgages at Dungarvan ; four carucates at Karebri; at Atornorohor the 
town on Rathet, with five carucates; in Kerry, ten carucates; and the 


churches and eccleſiaſtical benefices of all his lands in Ireland, however 


procured ; and whenever any of the ſaid churches and benefices ſhould 
become vacant, they were then to be converted to the uſe of the prior and 


convent ; the tithe of all his houſhold expences and of his wife's ; the 
tithe of all his rent, whether paid in money or otherwiſe; the chapelry 
of his court; and the tithe of all his mills and fiſheries, wool, flax, and 


hay, fowls and beaſts. Witneſſes, John archbiſhop of Dublin, W. biſhop 


of Glendaloch, and D. biſhop of Waterford. (f) | 
Meyler alſo built the town and church of Ardnorchur, and granted 


both to this priory after the deceaſe of Eliderus le Waleys, who was

he paying to the convent yearly pounds of wax ; the-prior of this 
houſe certainly did enjoy the ſame till the 4th or 5th year of King Henry III. 
when Matilda de Lacy recovered by law the advowſon of the church of 
Ardnorchur. (8) 


Henry was prior in the year 1209. 0 
William, the lord prior, was a fubſetibing wittiels to a grant made 


by Richard' of Caſtle Martin to the ae of the Holy Trinity, Dub-- 
lin. (i) 

1214. W. . . was prior. See Holy Trinity, Dublin. 

1220. William Mareſchal granted a charter to this priory, and died 
the ſame year. (k) | 

Ihe prior of this houſe had a great fait with Richard Fleming, bilk6p of 
Leighlin, for ſundry lands and tithes ſituated in Leix belonging to that ſee, 


but we find the Biſhop: gave them up to the prior, only reſcrving to him- 


ſelf and his ſucceſſors an annual penſion of ten mares; Richard, the bi- 
ſhop, died in the year 1226. (kk)

1281. Roger de Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, and Philip le Bockuad; his 


ſeneſchal of the county of Carlow, did about this time diſtrain the 


prior's cattle at Caniho, viz. ſeventy-ſeven ſheep, amounting in value 


to 100 ſhillings, for not attending the ſuit and ſervice of the ſaid Earl. 
The prior defended. himſelf, and made anſwer, that he owed no ſuch ſuit or 
ſervice, the ſaid manor being granted to his priory by William Earl of 


Pembroke, in free and pure alms. 00 
1340. William was prior; for in this year he ſued Walter Chriſtofre, 


in order to compel him to make up his accounts, for ſuch time as he had 
been bailiff to him in Ballycolryn in che county of Kildare. (m) 

1380. It was enacted by E that no mere Iriſhman ſhould 
make his profeſſion in this priory. (n) 

1406. The prior in this year, at the head of only twenty Engliſh, put 

to flight two hundred well-armed Iriſh on the Curragh of Kildare. (o) 

1412. Richard the prior died on the Monday next after the Purifica- 
tion of the bleſſed Virgin, and on the Thurſday following Philip Stoyll was. 
elected in his room (p), who continued prior till the year 1418. (q)

COUNTY great charges, and an of the prior of this houſe, granted to him and 
his brethren a full and free pardon for all offences, debts, ſervices and 
fines whatfoever due by them unto the Crown. 
1455. The King granted to the prior a power to acquire lands to the 
yearly value of 10 l. and the parliament then paſſed an act, empowering 
all thoſe to whom ſuch lands did belong, to alienate them to the prior of 
Conall. (r) 
| 1486. Nicholas * was prior (s); he was concerned in the rebellion 
raiſed in favour of Lambert Simnel ; but received the royal pardon for 
the ſame in the year 1488. (t) 
Ws Walter Welleſley was prior about this year, when the King 
(Hen. VIII.) made ſome ineffectual efforts to raiſe him to the epiſcopal ſee 
of Limerick; he was, however, ten years afterwards promoted to that 
of Kildare. Welleſley was for ſome time Maſter of the Rolls; and held 
this priory, with his biſhoprick, till the year 1539, when he died, and 
was buried in his own priory ; ; and, though his monument is much de- 
faced, there yet remains, in rude ſculpture, the figure of a biſhop, with 
his mitre, paſtoral ſtaff, and other ornaments, in bas relief. On the verge 
of the ſtone are theſe words, in Gothic characters: Hic jacet Walterus 
"66 Welleſley, quondam epiſcopus Darenſis, hujus domus commendatarius, 
< cujus animæ propitietur Deus. Qui obiit anno Domini M. D.. . (u)“ 
On a late inſpection of this tomb, the figure appears to have been 
broken acroſs at the neck, and the lower part is ſcarcely viſible. _ 

At the ſuppreſſion of monaſteries this, priory was feized of two gardens, 
with their appurtenances, in the town of Naas, ſituated to the ſouth and weſt 
of that village, and near the green on the road leading to Siggenſtown, 

together with ſeven acres of arable land near the Maudelein of Naas, 
and between that and Milltown mill; the rectory of Rohan alias Moy- 
rahye, in the King's county, the vicar of which had the cure, and was 
entitled to the third part of all the tithes and alterages of the ſaid. church ; 
the rectory was valued at three ſhillings Iriſh money; the rectory of Ly- 
nall alias Lynally, valued at three ſhillings, the vicarage being endowed ; 
the rectory of Kilbaghy, valued at three ſhillings ; the reQory of Bally-

valued at two ſhillings and eight pence; the rectory of Drumcullen, va-

KILDARE. 


to the care of the M*Egans, hereditary Chief Juſtices of Munſter. (u) 

Time having wholly. demoliſhed this ancient foundation, Dermit O'Dime- 
ſey, King of Offaley, by and with the conſent of Muredach O'Connor, did 
grant to the monks of St. Mary of Roſſglaſs, certain lands whereon to erect 
an abbey to the honour of the Virgin Mary ; namely, the ſite of the mona- 
ſtery, and all the lands of Eiothil and Rachehaiſhar, with the appurte- 
nances thereunto belonging ; Conarkerlan, Clonangay, Dere, Ardmidic, 
and Kilmore, with their appurtenances ; Glaſligelly, down to the river 
Barrow ; Hodinefol to Hadildred ; Hadclonan to the river Barrow ; Hen- 
ſeredan, with its appurtenances; Thacſartan and Archadacha-fernan. 
This deed was witneſſed by Nehemiah, biſhop of Kildare, and Donat, 
biſhop of Leighlin, conſequently it muſt have been executed between the 
years 1177 and 1185. (w) 

The copy of this charter, in the Monaſticon Anglicanum, volume II. 
p. 1031, differs ſomewhat in the ſpelling of the names. | 

A. D. 1199. The abbot John was made biſhop of Leighlin ; which, | 
however, he enjoyed but a ſhort time, as We are told he died in the year 
1201. (X) 

1297. The abbot being accuſed of receiving into his houſe many Iriſh 
felons, plunderers and robbers, of the country of Offaley, appeared and 
proved, that his abbey was ſituated in the marches, and out of the pale, 
and that he never, knowingly, received either felons or robbers. The 
jurors found, that he, (the abbot) had not voluntarily harboured ſuch 
men; and moreover, that he had not power to reſiſt or detain ſuch 
felons ; but that he had not made uſe of any means to raiſe the hue and 
cry; the abbot was hereupon fined half a marc. (y) 

The abbot of this houſe fat as a baron in parliament. _ 

At the general ſuppreſſion, this abbey was granted to George Lord 
Audley, who aſſigned the ſame to Adam Loftus, Viſcount Ely. It after- 
wards came into the Earl of Drogheda's family, by whom it was beauti- 
fully repaired, ſtill externally wearing the venerable appearance of an ab-

This town, 1 which the barony takes its name, is ſituated fourteen 


miles from Dublin; it was formerly of great note, being the reſidence of 
the Kings of Leinſter; on the arrival of the Engliſh it was fortified, many 


caſtles were erected, the ruins of which are partly viſible, and parliaments 
were held there; it has ſince ſuffered much from the ravages of time, and 
the decay of its former ſplendour. At preſent Naas is a market and bo- 
rough town, ſending burgeſſes to parliament. 


In the 12th century, the Baron of Naas founded a priory, under the 


invocation of St. John the Baptiſt, for Canons Regular of the order of 
St. Auguſtin. (a) 

1317. Thomas was prior, to whom William de London granted the 
mill of Killcuſſey for the term of twenty years; and on the 20th of July 


a licence was granted to John Roche, Geoffry le Brett, and William de 


London, to make over to this prior three meſſuages with their appurte- 
nances in Naas, her with the advowſon of the rectory and vicarage 
of Tylaghty. (b) 

A. D. 1326. We find that ſome lands in Walterſtown and Stoning- 
ſtown, in the county of Meath, were granted, by licence, to this houſe in 
pure and perpetual alms. (c) 

Same year the King, (Edward III.) for the fine of 40 ſhillings from the 


prior of the very poor houſe of the hoſpital of St. John, and through a 


motive of charity, granted a licence to him to acquire from Maſter Mau- 


rice Jakis, one meſſuage, together with a mill, one hundred acres of 
arable land, forty of meadow, and. four hundred of paſture, in Walter-. 


ſtown, and Styvenſtown. (d) 
Thomas was prior; he was ſucceeded by John.

KILDARE, mill in Walterſtown and Bin en near Norny, which the ſaid Wil- 


liam had obtained by diſſeizing Thomas, predeceſſor to the preſent prior. (e)

grant to this very poor hoſpital a licence to acquire certain lands in Walter. 


ſtown and Styvenſtown. (f) 
1348. The prior and canons of this houſe did this year receive a royal 


confirmation of their charters. (g) 


By an inquiſition taken in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, it appeared, 


that five acres of land in Styvenſtown in this county, and a mill in ruins, 
annual value bd. parcel of the poſſeſſions of this hoſpital, were a long 
time concealed from the Queen, by Edward Miſſet, of Dowdingſton. (h) 


By a patent dated October the 23d, in the year 1553, the poſſeſſions of 
this houſe, amounting in the whole to the yearly value of 35l. 18s. 2d. 


were granted to Richard Manneryng. (i) 


Dominican FRIAR Y; 
In the centre of this town, the family of Euſtace erefted a mona- 
ſtery under the invocation of St. Euſtachius, for Dominican friars (k); 
and it appears that their poſſeſſions in Naas were granted to them in the 


year 1355. (I) 

This friary, with its appurtenances, and five mine, eleven gardens, 
fifteen acres of arable land and three of paſture, were granted, together 
with the Gray friary of Clane, to Sir Thomas Luttrell, Knt. and his heirs, 
&c. in capite ; at the yearly rent of gs. 4d. Iriſh money. 15th June, 
34th Henry VIII. (m) 

A public Inn is now erected upon part of this ancient foundation. 


AUGUSTINIAN FRIARY; 


An houſe was founded here in 1484 (n) for friars eremites of the order 
of St. Auguſtin (0). The ruins of the building may ſtill be ſeen at the

This friary, with three gardens, containing three acres nnd three 
perches, with an acre of meadow in Callan, was granted, 13th Decem- 
ber, 1557, together with the abbey of Athaſſel, to Thomas Earl of Or- 


mond (p). See Athaſſel, in the county of Tipperary. 
The tower and walls of this friary ſtill remain; and it is probable, 
that the bones of the founder were laid in the wall, under two Got 


arches which yet ftand near the caſt window. 


CHAN TRY; 


In the pariſh church of Callan were two chantries under the invocation 
of the Holy Trinity and St. Catharine ; they ſtill exiſt and are called cha- 
pelries ; the chaplain muſt be in holy orders, and attend viſitations, &c. 


The preſentation, if we miſtake not, is now in lay hands. 

The nave of this church, with its fine lateral aiſles, ſtill remains in good 
preſervation ; the choir 1s now the parifh church, and the cemetery of 
the founder's family, overgrown with moſs and ivy, adjoins the choir.

A priory, under the invocation of t. Kiaran, was Fane os here in the 
L3th century, by the family of Blanchfield Y. for. regular Canons follow-- 
ing the rule of St. Auguſtin. 1 

A. D. 1396. The prior held the churches of Ferikeragh and 0 
more, in the dioceſs of Oſſory. | 

1566. The townlands of Fertnegeraghe, with the fite, &c. of the 
priory, and the lands of Donaghmore, in the county of Kilkenny, were 
held by Sir Edward Butler, of, Lowgrange, in the ſaid county, 9 : 
with divers other lands, at the 2c6tf part of a Knight's fee. (u) 

This priory paid annually to the biſhop-1 18. 7d. for W and 

21. for proxies (w) 
Oct. 8th, and gth of Q. Fliz. this monk with the appurtenances there- 
of, one ſtang of land, five cottages, and one hundred and one acres of 
land, in the town and lands of Fertnagera; with the rectory of the ſame, 
was granted for ever, in capite, to James Auer, junior, at the yearly 
rent of 121. 138. 3d. (x) 

There ſtill remains. here a ſmall ancient chapel, in which is a large raiſ-- 
ed tomb, with the figure of a man in armour rudely engraven thereon, 
his hands in a praying poſture, and a dog at his feet; by his fide was 
originally the figure of his wife, with an inſcription on the cuſhion, 
which lay under her head ; but this part of the tomb, now going to de- 
cay, is broken in two pieces, and the inſcription rendered illegible by 

time; this tomb is ſaid to belong to the family of Fitzpatrick. Near to 
it, is another tomb, which appears to be a woman, with a ſingular head- 
dreſs, riſing up on each fide, as biſhop Pococke deſeribes it, in two horns. 
In the eaſt wall is a ſmall figure of our Saviour, very inelegantly execut: 
ed; and a few yards weſt of the chapel ſtands a round tower, much de- 
cayed, being cracked quite up from the door, and wanting the top; 
it is about forty-eight feet in circumference, and the wall is three feet

* Philypp, deſcribed unto me the houſe of the White Fryers, which 


«© ſumtyme-was in that towne, concludinge in the ende, that the laſt prior.

This monaſtery, which belonged to the regular canons of St. Au- 


guſtin, was peculiarly and univerſally eſteemed, it was uncommonly 
extenſive, and amazingly enriched by various Kings and Princes ; its 
landed property was ſo great, and the number of cells and monaſteries 
ſubjected to it To numerous, that almoſt half of Ireland was ſaid to be 
within the bounds of Clonmacnoiſe: And what was a ſtrong inducement 
and contributed much towards enriching this houſe, it was believed, that 
all perſons who were interred in the Holy Ground belonging to. it, had 
inſured to themſelves a ſure and immediate aſcent to Heaven; many 
Princes (it is ſuppoſed for this reaſon) choſe this for the place of their 
ſepulture; it was the Jona of Ireland : yet notwithſtanding the reputed 
ſanctity of this monaſtery, and the high eſtimation in which it was held 
by all ranks of people, it appears from the foregoing hiſtory, that the ab- 
bey and town were frequently plundered, burnt and deſtroyed by de- 


ſpoilers of every kind, from the unpoliſhed Iriſh deſperado, to the em- 


purpled King : The abbey alſo ſuffered by the hands of the barbarous 
Oftmen, and not only by them, but (with concern do we add) by the En- 
gliſh then ſettled in the kingdom, whoſe errand hither, we would with to 
think, was to conciliate the affections of the people, to unite them in 


bonds of friendſhip, and teach them to live like fellow citizens and ſub- 


jects; inſtead of this, we are compelled to ſay, they too often joined in 
the ſacrilegious outrages of other wicked men, and repeatedly diſturbed 
and deſpoiled the peaceful ſeminary of Clonmacnoiſe ; ſparing neither book,

— COVIUED from Athlone; on the banks of the Shannon, and is raiſed above the 


river on ground compoſed of many ſmall elevations, on which are a few 
of the buildings which did belong to this ancient houſe: ſeveral other 


ruins appertaining to it may alſo be ſeen in the little vallies between the 


hills. The whole is bounded to the eaſt and north with very large bogs. 

Here are two round towers, elegantly built of hewn ſtone; the larger, 
which is called O' Rourk's, and wants the roof, is ſixty- two feet in height, 
and fifty - ſix in circumference, and the walls are three feet eight inches in 
chickneſs; the other tower, called MCarchy's, is ſeven feet in diameter 
within, and the walls are three in thickneſs, and fifty ſix in height, in- 
cluding the conical ſhaped roof. The next conſiderable building we find 
here is the cathedral, which was the ancient abbey, the doors of it are 


richly carved. There are ſeveral old monuments in this church, on 


which are inſcri; tions, ſaid to be partly in Hebrew and-partly in Irith.

Church, built by O'Melaghlin, King of ' Meath, and to this day it is the 
burial place of that family; Temple O'Connor, built by O'Connor Dun; 
Temple Kelly; Temple Finian, or M Carthy, built by M Carthy- more of 
Munſter ; Temple Hurpan, or M*Laffy's Church; Temple Kieran; Tem- 
ple Gauney ; Temple Doulin, which is now the oh church; and Tem- 
ple M Dermot; this laſt was much larger than any of the others, and be- 
fore the welt door ſtands a large old croſs of one entire ſtone, much de- 
faced by time, on which was ſome rude carving, and an inſcription in 
antique and unknown characters; the north doors are very low, but 
guarded with ſmall pillars of fine marble, curiouſly hewn. Another of

the command of Edward Bruce (u); and about the ſame time, David 


O'Buge, provincial of the order in Ireland, held a chapter here. ( )

ral of his order in Ireland, held a provincial chapter here, where many re- 
gulations were entered into, for the promotion of eccleſiaſtical diſci- 


pline. (y)

Theſe extenſive poſſeſſions were granted to Sir Gerald Moor, (p) who 


fixed his reſidence here, making the abbey a magnificent and deſirable 
- feats and at the ſame time a place of defence, as it bordered immediately 
on the Iriſh rebels; againſt whom the houſe conſtantly maintained itſelf un- 


til the 24th of November 1641, when a ſtrong party fat down before it. 


The garriſon, which conſiſted only of fifteen horſe and twenty-two foot, 


made a vigorous defence ; but their ammunition being exhauſted, the 


horſe forced their, way through the Iriſh camp to Drogheda, and were fol- 


lowed by the foot, who all effected an eſcape, eleven only excepted, 
which number the Iriſh ſacrificed to the manes of one hundred and twenty 


of their men, who were killed in the field of battle; Owen M*Mahon and 
another captain were found amongſt the ſlain. (g) 

Here yet remains, in tolerable preſervation, a beautiful little chapel, 
built of a yellowiſh free- ſtone, intermixed with red; the entrance to the cha- 
pel is thro' a ſuperb Gothic arch, which on the = 5p is exquiſitely finiſhed ; 
the eaſt window is truly elegant, and on each fide are three ſmaller win- 
dows, finiſhed in the ſtyle of the great arch, which is accurately repreſented 
in Wright's Louthiana ; the work of this arch, as well as that of the win- 
dows, pillars, &c: have ſtill the remains of a profuſion of gilding, and 
painting in variegated colours. Here is alſo to be ſeen the ruins of a 
ſpacious octagon erection, built of a light-grey free-ſtone, on the top of 
which was a large ciſtern, from whence water was conveyed, by means of 
pipes, to the different offices in the abbey.

Tuſcan pillar, from a baſe of Achtern feet; its circumference is ſeventeen COUNT Y 
yards, and the wall, built of a ſlaty ſtone of which the ſurrounding hills are 7 OI. 


compoſed, is three feet ſix inches thick, the door is five feet ſix inches in 
height, twenty-two inches in width, and fix feet from the preſent level of 
the ground, it is arched and built of free-ſtone, as are the windows of 
the chapels ; in the inſide the diameter is nine feet, and above the door it 
is divided into five ſtories, by rings of ſtone ſlightly projecting. (m) 
There are two large croſſes on the ſouth-ſide of the church, the principal 
one is ſaid to be of an entire ſtone, and is called St. Boyne's Croſs, which 
is the moſt ancient religious relique now extant in Ireland ; the orna- 
mental figures on it are rudely engraven, and at once ſhow the uncivi- 


lized age in which they were executed; there is alſo an inſcription on this 


croſs in the old Iriſh character, equally inclegant with the figures, ſome 
letters of which appear and evidently form the word Muredach, who was 
for ſome time King of Ireland, and died A. D. 534; about one e 
years after the arrival of St. Patrick. (n) 

This abbey continues to be a burial place of note.

In the barony of Coſtello. One of the family of Nangle founded a 


monaſtery here for Dominican Friars, and dedicated it to St. Thomas (m). 


This family afterwards. took the name of Coſtello, and became Lords 
of the barony ; the followers of St. Dominick ſeated themſelves here in 
the year 1430, without a licence from the Pope, but they obtained 
one from Eugene IV. who made a grant of the ſame, by a bull bearing 
date 18th of March, 1434. Urlare, or in Iriſh Orlare, which ſignifies 
an area, is in a retired ſituation, and was therefore appointed: for the ge- 
neral reception of Novices throughout the province of Conaught. We 
are told, that in ancient times there was a town here, but at preſent 


there is not a veſtige of one to be ſeen, and the ruins of the r alone 


preſerve this place from total oblivion. (n) 

By an inquiſition taken 1 2th May, 1608, 1t appears that the prior of 
Orlare was ſeized of the ſite, &c. and of twelve acres of arable land, with 
the tithe, &c. thereunto belonging. And in an inquiſition taken 24th of

BALLYBOGAN; 

Called for EE time the priory de Laude Dei; Was ſituated in the . 
rony of Moyſinrath, on the river ee and three miles ſouth of Clo- 
nard. 

A priory was founded here for canons of the' order of St. Auguſtin, in

Trinity. (s) 

Whilſt Hugh Tachmon, pathop of Meath, enjoyed the | pits ſee,

1399. By an inquiſition taken in this year, it was found that John 


O'Mayller, a mere Iriſhman and of the Iriſh ſept of the O'Mayllers, ene- 


mies to our Lord the King, was inſtituted to the priory of the Bleſſed Vir- 
gin of Ballybogan, contrary to the form of the ſtatute of Kilkenny ; but 
Richard Cuthbert did, on the ſame day, make due proof that the ſaid priory 
was not under the invocation of the Virgin Mary, but dedicated to the 
Holy Trinity, and that he was the lawful prior thereof. CUUIDErt was 
accordingly reſtored to the temporalities. (sss) 

1404. The King (Henry IV.) granted in cane to William Sto. 
kynbrygge, of Dublin, (Peter Moutenay and Edmund Mercer, of the 
county of Lancaſter being his ſureties) the ſeveral lands and tenements be- 
longing to the prior of Ballybogan, in Cabragh, in the county of Dublin ;

BEAVUBEC; 


1s in the- Rune direction from Drogheda as Beamore. In the reign 
of King John, Walter de Lacie, Lord of Meath, did grant to the church 
of St. Mary and St. Laurence of Beaubec, all his land fituate in the 
townland of Killokerran (now called the manor of RIES, ET 
with the liberty of keeping a boat free of toll, &c. (a) | 

1332. King Edward the firſt, granted a licenſe to the abbot of Beau- 
bec in Normandy, to aflign to the abbot of Furnes in Ireland, the manor 

of Beaubec near Drogheda, together with three meſſuages, ſixty acres and 

an half of land, and fifty-ſeven ſhillings and nine-pence annual rent ariſing 

from Marinſton, Renneles, and the town of Drogheda on both ſides of 

the river, alſo a fiſhery in the Boyne ; ſaving bewever to dhe Lords of the 

fee their proper ſervices. (6b } 

1348. King Edward, in a charter dated May ah, recites and repeats 
the grant of Walter de Lacie, and farther ſays, that King Henry III. had 
confirmed the ſame, and that the abbot of Beaubec, of the Ciſtertian 
order, had afterwards, with the King's licenſe, granted the aforeſaid 
manor of Beaubec to o. che abbot of Furnes. ( 


Ts fituated three miles caſt of Trim, in the Liga is 8 and on

Lacie, () which had been a tic time detained by the Iriſh, was interred COUNTY 


with much ſolemnity in this * but his head was . in the abbey 
of St. Thomas in Dublin. (f) 

Same year, Simon Rochfort, Bp. of Meath, and his decem, together 
with Gllebert prior of Duleek, being appointed by Pope Innocent III. to de- 
cide the controverſy between the monks of this abbey and the canons of St. 
Thomas in Dublin, concerning the right to the body of Hugh de Lacie, 
deceaſed; they accordingly gave ſentence on St. Valentine's s day in this 
year in nr, of the abbey of St. Thomas. (g) 

1340. John was abbot. See the abbey of Dunbrody, county 5 Wex- 
ford. 

I 376. John was abbot, a8 appears by the King's (Edward III. % writ to 
deliver Patrick Cathaſſagh from priſon ; who was proſecuted and excom- 
municated in the court of the archdeaconry of Meath, for defaming the 
faid abbot, and in conſequence of ſuch proceedings, as we ſuppoſe, the 
ſaid Patrick had appealed to the Pope. (i) 


1488. The abbot James of  Caſtlemartin received the King's pardon 


for the part he had taken in the rebellion raiſed on account of Lambert 
Simnell ; and ſame year, on the 25th of Julyz he took the oath of fideli- 
ty to King Henry VII. (A) 

About this time, we are told, that Iſmaena, widow of Jorel Com; 
brought her writ of dower againſt the abbot of this houſe for the third 
part of a meſſuage, and ſixty-ſix acres of land in Ballybret, at which time 
ſhe paid a fine of one marc ; whereupon the abbot agreed for himſelf and 


ſucceſſors, that a chaplain ſhould be found particularly to celebrate a con- 


ſtant ſervice for the repoſe of her ſoul and the ſouls of her anceſtors (I).

MONASTICON 


CARMELITE FRIAAVY; 


This friary is alfo fituated on the Meath fide of the river, and was 


founded by the inhabitants of Drogheda, for Carmelites or White friars, 
to the honour of the Bleſſed Virgin. (n) 


It appears by an inquiſition by oh in the firſt year of King Edward I 


that the corporation of Drogheda had granted to the friars of this order, 


a piece of land containing eighty virgates (o); and 23d June, 1346, the 
King (Edward III.) granted a licenſe to Richard, the ſon of William 


Maſſager of Drogheda, permitting him to aflign to this houſe four acres 


of land adjoining the ſame, with the appurtenances, for the purpoſe of 
encreaſing and maintaining the lights before the Holy Virgin in this 
church. (p) 

In the year 1468 it was enacted by W that this convent mould 
for ever enjoy a chief rent of ten ſhillings yearly, which had been granted 


to the burgeſſes of the town. (q) 


Part of this friary was afterwards repaired for the ſervice of the pariſh. (49)

who Placed over it St, Diermit me biſhop. (s) 


DRUIMFINCHOILz; 


A religious houſe of this name was founded in the ancient territory of 
Meath, by St. Columb and St. Lugad, who appointed the ſon of Tuchan 
to be the firſt abbot. (t) This alſo is buried in oblivion.

(Do Un E E R; 


This almoſt deſolated village has its ſituation four miles ſouth-weſt of 
Drogheda, and from the ruins which are every where obſervable, we muſt 


ſuppoſe it was once a town of note; at preſent it retains no other marks 


of ancient magnificence than giving name to the barony, and being repre- 
ſented by two members in parliament. 


An abbey was built here by St. Patrick, who placed St. Kienan- or Cienan 


over it, whom he had baptized in the year 450; and this Saint, after reſiding 

a conſiderable time in France, returned to Ireland, and erected a church 
of lime and ſtone here. (w) St. Patrick is ſaid to have given to this Saint 

his own book of the Holy Evangeliſts. (x)

COUNTY 


of 
MEATH. 


moxatrioen 


LOUGH SHILLEN, ; 


Adjoins the counties of Meath, Weſtmeath, and Cavan. On an Hand 
on this lough, and near to the county of Meath, the ruins of a large friary 
are yet to be ſeen, which was built here in an earlier age; we know not 
to whom the erection is owing, nor to what order the houſe did belong, 


but to this day it continues a burial place of note.

| This town is ſituated at the conflux of the river Blackwater and the 
Boyne ; it gives name to the barony, is a market-town and borough, and 


ſends repreſentatives to parliament ; in former ages it was MN! in ae, 


and was walled by Hugh de Lacie f 

An abbey for Regular Canons was erected here under the invocation of 
the Virgin Mary, whether it exiſted before the end of the 12th century 
we are at a loſs to determine, but about that period it was either founded

ATHLONE; 


Situated on the river Shannon, is a invoke and borough town, ren- 


and gives the title of Earl to the noble family of Ginkle. Here we find 
an abbey, which was founded for Ciſtertian monks under the invocation 
of St. Peter. Other writers give the dedication to St. Benedict, and ſay 
it was founded for monks of his order. In a table of the procurations of 
the church of Elphin, this is called the monaſtery de Innocentia. (r) 

1216. King John, by a grant dated 3oth May, gives to this abbey 
four carucates of land in the fee of Lagſcueth, in exchange for the ſite, 
on which he erected the caſtle of Athlone, and granted to the ſaid monks 
the tenth of the expences of the aforeſaid caſtle. (s)

together with three chapels in the barony of Athlone, viz. Cama, Kil- 


| toame, and Drayme, which were long under the name of vicarages; but 


we find that a monk belonging to this abbey officiated in each of theſe 
chapels, from time to time, till the final ſuppreſſion and received 
annually thereout three parts of the tithes belonging to the ſame, 
which were found of the following amount : the chapel of Cama, forty 
ſhillings ; Kiltoame, twenty Age 1 : and . ten ſnillings; all Iriſh 
money. (W) 

8th September, 2oth Queen Elisabeth; a grant was made to Edmund

By another inquiſition, taken the th of ſame King, it was fondd that 
a parcel of land in the county of Sligo, called Tryne de Cloncagh, contain- 
ing one quarter; and a third of another quarter, lying and fituate in the 
pariſh of Towewer and baronyof Corren, with a ruined chapel or ſmall 
church, did belong to this abbey, of the annual value of 12d. Iriſh ; but fome 
of the ſept of the M*Donoghs claimed the faid lands as their property. (pp) 

4th December, 160 . This n, was granted to Sir John King,

The remains of this ancient ereQion are faflicjent to Gow its priſtine mag- 
nificence. The ruins lie at the back of the town, and are encloſed in the de- 
meſne of the Earl of Kingſton. The chancel and a ſmall chapel on either fide 
are roofed ; the great arches which ſupported the tower were forty-five'or 
forty-ſix feet in height, but the ground is now ſo raiſed as to cover all the 
baſes of the columns ; one half of the arches are ſupported by round pil- 


lars, built of cut ſtone, of various ſizes, and the reſt are a group of ſmall 
columns, or moldings ; all the ſpaces between thoſe pillars are now filled 


up, fo as to make a folid wall, and which, as we ſuppoſe, was done in 
the reign of Queen Elizabeth, when the abbey was converted into a place 


of defence. Some of the capitals are plain, others are ornamented with 


carvings, and the eaſt window was grand and loſty. There are no re- 
mains to be ſeen of the cloiſter, that part being long ſince converted into a 
barrack, The ſtump of a round tower near the abbey is ſtill to be ſeen.

it was wholly conſumed by an accidental fire, and all its ſacred edifices 
were deſtroyed; but Pope John X XIII. by a bull dated January 17th, in 
the following year, granted many indulgences to all viſiting this houſe on 
certain feſtivals, likewiſe to thoſe who contributed to refound it; (q) and 
from this æra we are to date the foundation of the preſent building.

The few ruins of this fpacious and beautiful viaſtery evince its 
former ſplendour; three ſides of the cloiſter may ſtill be ſeen, co- 
vered with an arched roof; the arches and pillars are of extraordi- 
nary workmanſhip, and a few of the pillars are ornamented with 
ſculpture. The great eaſt window is beautiful, and the high altar, 
| adorned with relievo's in the Gothic ſtyle, is now ſo overwhelmed with 
bones and ſkulls, (the quantity, as we are told, being ſufficient to load 
a ſmall veſſel) as to prevent a minute deſcription. The nave is ſpa- 
cious, with a paſſage round it in the nature of a gallery, and ſupported 
by pillars of ſtone about four feet diſtant from each other. In the cor- 
ner, to the right as you look towards the altar, is the tomb of O*Conor, 
with the figures of himſelf and lady, and an inſcription now almoſt 
defaced. Here are alſo ſeveral vaults and cells, and the tower in the 
centre is pretty entire except the battlements. This great and curious 
monument of antiquity ſeems to have fallen a prey rather to the devouring 
teeth of time than to the hands of man; although Cromwell is faid to 


have done ſome injury to it. a)

of 


Tipperary. 


the term of one hundred and one years, at the annual rent of 528. 6d. 
Iriſn money. The lands, &c. here enumerated, were concealed by Tho- 
mas Earl of Ormond and his ſucceſſors. (I 1203 


The ruins of this abbey ſhow: it to have been equal, if not + better to 


"any monaſtic edifice in this kingdom ; the choir meaſures forty-four feet 
in length and twenty-ſix and an half in breadth; on the north and ſouth 
ſides are ſmall aifles, which we rather e were deſigned for ſome 
other purpoſe, as their communication with the main building is by doors 
. parallel to the chuir, &c.; on the ſouth ſide is a long range, with one en- 
tire low arch, twenty. four feet broad and thirty-ſeven long; it then di- 
miniſhes to ten feet in width, and ſtretches out twenty- four feet longer; 


on the weſt end thereof, and on the ſouth ſide of the nave, are part of the 


windows and outer walls of the cloiſters, forming a ſquare of ſixty- three 
feet; on the ſouth ſide is another long range of building, with the lower 


part divided by arches. The nave appears to have been of the ſame 


breadth with the choir, and ſupported by lateral aiſles; it meaſures by 
the exterior walls one hundred and ſeventeen feet in length and fifty-eight 


in breadth ; in the ſouth-weſt corner is a ſmall chapel, with an arched 


roof ſuſtained by diagonal and central ogives. The ſteeple was a lofty 
ſquare building, of which the ſouth ſide only remains. About forty yards 
weſt of the nave is an entrance through a ſmall gate, wherein had been a 


portcullis ; ; the paſſage to this is by a {mall ancient bridge, over a low, 


marſhy piece of ground; the view from hence, through the nave and 


ſteeple, terminating at the high altar, muſt have been highly pictureſque. 


Io deſcribe minutely each part of this extenſive ruin would be inſufferably 
tedious; we ſhall therefore only add, that the whole work was uniform, 
regular, and hnilhed.2 in a a fine ae

Laſt day of February 1576, a leaſe of this abbey! (ſpecifying neither 
rent nor term) was granted to James Butler; (t) and 42d ſame Queen, a 
new grant of this abbey was made to Thomas Stack, - at he annual rent 
of 28, Iriſh money, () | 

The noble ruins of this erection nal, remain, and are for the mol part 
entire. The ſteeple is large, and about twenty feet | ſquare on the inſide, 
which 18 ſupported by a variety of ogives from cach angle, ſome meeting 
in an octagon in the center, and others at the key ſtones of the vault, 
and the ſtru g ure is ſupported by two fine arches about thirty feet high. 
The choir or chapel, which adjoins the caft fide of the ſteeple, is about 
twenty- nine feet in length and twenty-four in breadth on the inſide ; the 
eaſt window is ſmall and plain; and in the fide walls are fome remains of 
ſtalls, &c. The nave is ſixty feet in length, twenty-three in breadth, and 


on each fide was an arcade of three Gothic arches, the north fide whereof 


is levelled, with lateral aiſles, which were about ' thirteen feet broad; be- 
tween this and the ſteeple is a part, but we are equally ignorant as to its 


name and the uſe it was applied to, it is thirty-one feet in length, of the 


ſame breadth with the nave, and divided from the Reeple by a plain wall; 


on each fide are ſimilar arcades of two arches only, and this opens with 5 
the welt arch of the ſteeple. On the ſouth fide of the ſteeple is a ſmall 


door leading into an open part, about thirty feet long and twenty-four 


broad ; the fide walls are much broken, and in the gable end is a long 
window; there is a ſimilar diviſion on the north fide of the ſteeple. Here 
is a ſmall, low, arched apartment, which ſeems to have been a confeſſion- 


ary, as there are niches in the wall, with holes, &c. 3

This ancient, celebrated, and archiepiſcopal city, in the barony of Clan- 
william, and ſixteen miles weſt of Caſhel, was in its zenith till 1 578, 
when it was united to that ſee: thus diſrobed of its conſequence, Emly 
fell a ſacrifice to time, and became, though yet a village, a ſcene of deſo- 
lation. Originally its ſituation was much more beautiful than at preſent, 
being immediately ſeated on a conſiderable lake, conſiſting of two 
hundred acres, which on account of its value, was Py drained by the 
neighbouring proprietors in the year 1718. 

Here we find an abbey of Canons Regular which was founded by St. 
Ailbe, who, on account of his at u life, was ſtyled another St. Pa- 
trick ; he became the firſt abbot and biſhop of this monaſtery; and, dying

wood in the town of Holy Croſs ; one ruined meſſuage, ſixty: acres of 


land, and one of wood in Rilken; ſixteen acres in Bellekelle; two meſ- 
ſuages, four cottages, and twenty-four, acres af land in Lifargonok; 
thirty acres in Kilcomen z twenty acres. in I hurles; in this county: one 
meſſuage, thirty-two acres of arable, and fix of paſture in Ballintenra, 


county of Kilkenny; one cloſe near the town of Carlow, containing a 


garden, an orchard, and three acres of paſture; and ſeven acres in Bal- 
lyſhean and Maynooth, in the county of Kildare; were granted to Gerald 
Earl of Ormond, in capite, ut the annual rent of 151. 108. 4d. () 

In the winter of 155%, the great rebel O'Neal made a pilgrimage e to a 
piece of the Croſs which was ſaid to have been e in- this ab- 
bey. ())) 


The e 8 this "SR was Sec, ben . build- 
ing conſiſts of an high ſteeple nearly ſquate; ſupported] on each fide. by a 
beautiful Gothic arch, and in the center by a great variety of ogives pal- 
ſing diagonally from each angle, &c. : on the eaſt fide thereof is a ſmall 
chapel, twenty-one feet in breadth and twenty-four in length; the roof is 
arched, and beautifully ſupported by a number of ogives from the ſides 
and: angles; on the ſouth fide, is a Gothic tomb, which, according to 
O'Halloran, is that of the founder, with a croſs thereon but no in- 
ſcription; the tradition of the place however informs os, that this tomb 
was erected for the Good woman who brought the holy relique hither: 
between the nave and ſteeple is a {pace of twenty-one feet ſix inches in 
breadth and thirty in length, detached from the nave by an arch, which, 


we ſuppoſe, made a part of the choir: the nave is forty-nine feet broad 


and fifty- eight long; on each fide is an arcade of four arches, with lateral 
aiſles which paſs on either ſide of that part we conclude to have been the 


choir: the entrance is by a door at the welt end, under a large window. 


On the ſouth ſide of the choir are two chapels, each about ten fett ſquare, 


and both of them arched and ſupported as the other parts of the building; 
between theſe are a double row! of Gothic arches, ſupported by twiſted 
pillars, each diſtant about two feet four inches from the other ; here the

relique was kept, as remarked by a reſpectable writer, in a plate hien ehen 
by miſtake is reverſed: on the north ſide of the choir are two other cha- 
pels, each of them ſeven feet long and eleven broad, with roofs ſupported | 
in like manner as the others; and between theſe and the oppoſite lateral 
_ aiſle the whole is arched; but 6ppoſite the ſouth chapel there is an open 
ſpace, with a large flight of ſtairs leading to the ſteeple, &c. ; in the north 
angle of which are ſtairs which aſcend to the top. The rence 1 in the 
work of this monaſtery i is very extraordinary; nothing could have been 
more highly finiſhed than the ſteeple and chapels, which are built of mar- 
ble and limeſtone, yet the nave, the ailes, and adjoining ruins, are mi- 
ſerably mean. On the ſouth ſide the ruins cover a conſiderable ſpace. 
The river Suire, which before it reaches the ſea is ſo amazingly exten- 
five, flows near the "ruins of this monaſtery in a ſmall ſtream. A pa- 
riſh church with'a few WEIGEL cabbins are the only remains of a once 


8 town.

INISLOUNAGH; 


In the | brody af Oda and Iffa, on che banks of the Suire, and three 
miles and an half weſt of Clonmell. St. Mochoemoc, or the Beautiful, 
founded an abbey at Inifteam hnacta, which he dedicated to the Virgin 
Mary, and died 13 March, A. D. 655. (2) Congan was abhot of this mo- 
naſtery, and he communicated to St. Bernard the materials for compoſing 
the life of his cotemporary St. Malachy, who died in 1153. (a) 

Donald O Brien, King of Limerick, refounded this abbey, in the year 
1187, and endowed it, with the aſſiſtance of Malachy O'Foelan, Prince 
of the Decies. (b) It is not improbable that the monks of this houſe came 
originally from ſome other monaſtery near the river Suire. (c) 

1238. Marian O'Bryde, W of Caſhel, died in this abbey, where 
he was interred: (d) wy 

1240. This abbey received a new colony of monks from Funet 
in Lancaſhire, (e) and in the year 1311 Richard was abbot; for 
we find him foed by Michael, the ſon of William-de Lanſtaſtafford, as

The monaſtery of Monaincha, ſituated almoſt in the centre of the great. 
bog of Monela, in the barony of Ikerrin and about three miles ſouth-caſt

ancient ; an handſome Gothic arch, which ſeparates the body of this 
church from the chancel, yet remains, and the pillars ſupporting it are 
more maſſive than thoſe of the Tuſcan order, which denotes the antiquity 
of the building; the chancel is roofed, and at preſent is uſed for divine 


ſervice. On the weſt end of this church are ſome figures in alto relievo, 


in freeſtone, venerable for their antiquity, viz. Adam and Eve, with the

The ruins of this abbey (being the firſ which a traveller perceives) are 
ſituated in the bottom of the vale, and: conſiſt of two buildings parallel 
to each other (the larger one on the ſouth being the church ;) on the eaſt 
end of the abbey is an arch, of extremely curious workmanſhip ; the co- 


lumns on the ſides recede one behind another, and are very ſhort, but 
do not diminiſn; the capitals are ornamented in a ſingular manner, moſt 


of them with boman heads at the angles, and dragons or other fabulous 
animals at the fides ; the heads have much the appearance of thoſe in 
Egyptian ſculpture, wh large ears, long eyes, and the treſſes of the hair 
ſtrait 3 the ring-ſtones of the arch are indented triangularly, in imitation of 
the Suren architecture, and in ſome parts human heads and other ornaments 


are within the triangular mouldings. On the removal of ſome heaps of rub- 
biſh from under the ruins of this arch, a few ſtones beautifully carved were 


found, many of them belonging to the arches, and ſome to the architrave 
of the window; the architrave is twelve inches broad, and a pannel is ſunk,

a bead running on each ſide; the centre of the lozenge is decorated on 


one ſide, in bas relief, with a knot delicately carved; the other with a 


flower in the centre, and mouldings correſponding to the ſhape of the lo- 
zenge. The half-lozenge, at the bottom of the pilaſter, in one is filled 
with a bas relief of a human head, with a bird on each fide pecking at the 
eye, and the other by a dragon, eviſting its head round and the fail turn- 
ed up between its legs into the mouth. Here is another ſtone, apparently 
the capital of a column; two ſides of it are viſible, both are orna- 
mented with a patera, bt each fide in a different manner; one conſiſts 
of a flower of fixteen large leaves and fifteen ſmaller ones, relieved the 
cighth of an inch, and the other of ſix leaves branching an the centre, 


with another leaf extending between their points.
