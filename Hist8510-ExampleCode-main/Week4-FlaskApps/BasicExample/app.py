Simple Flask Web Application Demo
================================

How to run:
1. Install Flask: pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the app: python3 app.py
3. Open browser: http://localhost:5001

Routes:
- / (home page): Shows a list of 10 venues
- /venue/<id> (venue detail): Shows detailed info for one venue
Database:
- Uses SQLite database: ../Week3-SQL-Queries/sc_gay_guides.db
- Tables: venues, cities
- Joins venues with cities to get location information
