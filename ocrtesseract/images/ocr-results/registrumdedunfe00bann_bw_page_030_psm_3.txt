XXIV PREFACE. been prefixed to the present work, and with the help of tables of the Ear] of Haddington, applicable to the more modern matter, has been made to serve the pur- pose both of a reference to the original, and a table of the contents of the printed volume. The contents of the first Appendix, consisting of the Apoeryphal charter of Maleolm III! and of nine bulls and charters,’ printed from the originals in the Advocates’ Library, have been already referred to. The Seeond Appendix, the Rental of the Abbacy, as taken up in 1561 and suc- cessive years, under the Aet appropriating the thirds of benefices to the ministers of religion and to the Crown, is printed from a volume of Lord Haddington’s Collee- om tions in the same Library.® The Third Appendix gives the contents of five volumes of feu-rights and other charters and leases granted by the successive Abbots or Commendators of Dunferm- lin, of the property belonging to, or held under their House; and by Queen Anne of Denmark, “ Ladie of Duniermelyn.” The first of these* is now in the possession of the Marquess of Tweeddale, the heritable Baillie of the Regality of Dunfermlin. On its first leaf it bears the following inseription;—MNorum rentale seu reaistrum terrarum ad Regalituten de Dunfermling spectantium anno millesimo quingentesimo quinqua- gesimo quinto per dominum Joannem .... . . monachum professum ejusdem de man- dato Reverendi [etrt} Georaii Durie commendutarii (dieti] monasterti . I. Henrisone chartarius, notarius publicus. The inventory of its contents is from Haddington’s Colleetions,® collated with the original volume. The second volume® is not now known to exist. The inventory of its contents is copied from Lord Haddington. The third,’ of which: the contents are also described from Lord Haddington’s inven- tory, is now in the General Register House, and it has been collated for this work. The inventories of the contents of the fourth volume,® which is in the poss ion of the Marquess of Tweeddale, and of the fifth which is preserved in the Advocates Library, are not contained in Lord Haddington’s eollections, but have been made up from the originals. As a body of ancient statistical and local information, it is hoped this volume may be found even richer than any of the former published chartularies. These records are gradually extending over Seotland a net-work of local and eharter history, which will save us in future from ignorant guessers, and lay a foundation for that MSS, Ade, Libr, 32,2. 5.
