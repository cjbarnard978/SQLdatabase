PREFACE, Nxili It is neeessary briefly to explain the arrangement of the present volume.—The tirst 189 pages contain what may be most correetly styled the Ancient Register, begun probably early in Alexander 11.’s reign, and brought down nearly to the end of that of his son, Following the arrangement of the original, it is divided under the heads of the different classes of granters. In the class of Crown grants,! the only liberty used is in plaeing the great confirmatory charter of each reign at its commencement, which is not always the ease in the Reeord, though it does not pretend to place them chronologieally. The charters of the Bishops? have been only so far altered in ar- rangement as to place the successive Bishops in right order of suceession, In the section of eharters of laymen,® the order of the original has been adhered to; but the bulls of the Popes.t where asecrtainable with certainty, have been oceasionally altered in position to suit chronology. The remainder of the Register,> ineluding charters interpolated on the leaves of the most aneient part, has been arranged, not with reference to the supposed period of registration, but in conformity with the actual or eonjeetural date of the various instruments. Those of lowest dates, least importanee, and greatest bulk, have been abridged at the end. It has heen endeavoured to preserve in every case the exact operative terms of the original, and all clauses and even expressions unusual or otherwise interesting, as well as the names of the witnesses, where these were other than the members of the convent. In every book of register like the present, are found writs undated. and evi- dently designed as styles. These have been colleeted, and are here placed at the eonelusion of the Abbreviates ;7 and lastly. nine entries, omitted in arranging the work for the press, are subjoined.* The only remaining matter of the volume, known under the name of the Char- tulary of Dunfermlyn, is a“ tabill” of some antiquity, referring to the contents of the volume before its more recent additions at the beginning and end.
