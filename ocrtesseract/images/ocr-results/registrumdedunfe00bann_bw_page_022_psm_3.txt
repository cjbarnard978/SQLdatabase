The Abbacy, with other great benefices, was now a subject of fieree contention between the family of Hepburn and Andrew Forman, Archbishop Legate,—a dispute which ranked all the nobility of Scotland with one or other of the parties. James Hepburn assumed the title of Abbot in 1515,° as chosen by the Convent. The Le- gate held a prior grant from the Pope. The law was not quite clear ; but, at any rate, it was not heard in such eases, in the regeney of Albany. The Regent endea- voured to appease the factions by a compromise, in 1517; and the Abbaecy of Dun- fermlin fell to the share of the Archbishop, while James Hepburn had the Bishop- vick of Moray. Andrew Forman was buried in the Abbey Church in 1522.° James Beton, Archbishop of Glasgow. who succeeded Forman in the Primacy. was his suecessor also in the Abbacy of Dunfermlin, which he held a second time én commendam, and afterwards styled himself usufrauctuarius, or administrator fruc- tuum, while he allowed the name and probably devolved the duties of Abbot on George Dury. George Dury. Archdeacon of St. Andrews, styled himself Abbot of Dunfermlin in 1530,* and he coutinued to take the title of Abbot or Commendator, apparently subordinate te the Archbishop, during the life of the latter.
