It is not of mere wantonness that these proofs of the authenticity of this Register are arrayed, but chiefly from the importance that has been attached to the style in which the leading charters of David I. and his suecessors run. > 2a nonine sancte et individue trinitutis, Ego Dauid Dei aratia Rex Scottorum, auctoritate regia ac potestate; Episcoperum, Comitum Baronumque reqni met confirmatione et testimonio ; Clero etiam adquicscente et Populo >’ —these are very formal terms of sanction, and to a mind predisposed to adinit the theory, readily take the shape of a solemn legisla- tive enactment, by the authority of the King’s most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons in Par- liament assembled.!
