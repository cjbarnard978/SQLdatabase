PREFACE. xix laws, and tustitutions. which must have been mentioned if thry existed—must be settled some of those great questions of history and constitutional law, and even of national independence, which have been so long and warmly diseussed in this country. The Ancient Register of Dunfermlin has long been preserved in the Advocates Library at Edinburgh.! Thongh recently bound, it is otherwise in precisely the same state as when it formed the subject of the research and labour of the first Earl of Haddington more than two centuries ago. That careful antiquary has left among his collections? a minute description of this Register, a table of its contents. both of whieh have been used for the present work,* and a great body of extracts intended to throw light on the ancient tenures and forms of conveyancing of Scotland. Like all Registers of this kind, the MS. is of very different ages. In truth. the ancient Record has served as a nucleus, round which have been gathered the successive deeds of the Monastery. Ina few instances, deeds of later date have been interpolated on blank pages among the more ancient writs; but these are easily distinguishable by the form of writing as well as the substance. sent noticing these farther, we may speak of what Haddington calls * The Auld Withont at pre- Registre,” as of a methodical compilation, and though not always placed contiguously, forming a definite portion of the volume. Tt is arranged under heads ;—Charters of the Kings from David to Alex. 111..° the Bishops of Saint Andrews® and Dunkeld ;7 the Chapter of St. Andrews ;* the Earls of Fife? and Athol ;"” Countesses Ada and Ela ;" Charters of Laymen :! Covenants and conventions regarding disputed territories ;¥ and Bulls of Popes." The hand writing of the greater part of the Record now described, may be ascribed, without much doubt, to the reign of Alexander II. or the early half of the 13th century. 111 wasin that Library in the time of Bishop Nichol- son (£fistor, Libr.) and Dalrymple, at the end of the SMS. Ade. Libr, 34.2. 2. (4. 4.16.) This is the volume descrihed by Mr. Robertson. Earl 17th century. 2 Mr. Robertson, in his useful “index of charters,” while describing a volume of Haddington’s collections, mentions a part, entitled, Cutulogee Minute of the Register of Dumfermeting,” and adds, “ of the fate of the hooks to which this part of the volume relates, the editor is ignorant. Many particulars contained in it seem worthy the attention of an antiquary.’—Pust- seript, p. Xlvii,. While the worthy gentleman was writ- ing his note, he mnst have been in the very room, and handling volumes from the very press, if not the same shelf, which eontained the principal of “ the books to whieh this part of the volume relates," and the one containing all the “ particulars” Mr. Robertson thought worthy of altention. Haddington does not state where the Register was deposited when he used it. * Prefixed, under the gencral title, Telu‘«.
