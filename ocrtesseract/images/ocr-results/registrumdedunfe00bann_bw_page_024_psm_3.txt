xvili PREFACE. has often longed for something to fix the era of undated charters or events recorded only in connexion with the Abbot of the day.' Like the other great: monasteries of Scotland, Dunfermlin acquired the great mass of its property at a very early period of its history; and the aequisition of a considerable portion may be ascribed to the period immediately succeeding the restoration of Maleohn ILT., when the national convulsion, and the defeat of the other great party, placed in the power of the Crown a great quantity of disposable property In these possessions, as well as in those heaped on the Abbey by David I. and his successors, so far as they consisted in landed estates, it would appear that other parties soon aequired a quasi title of possession under the Church. Long before feu-charters were granted, and probably without the solemnity of any written titles, we find families holding extensive lands hereditarily under the Abbot, and vindicating in them some right of property. When disputes oceurred, the Abbot, who had not only the keeping but the framing of his own record, had. of course, the better; or if in any instances he was unsuccessful, such events were not likely to find a place in this Register. The palpable temptation to deceit in framing their Register, and the opportu- nity for it enjoyed by the only reading and writing class of the community, lead us to examine somewhat critically, the records by whieh a great house like Dunfermlin held its poss But this is really a more serious enquiry toa Seotchman. We have here a great Register professing to record, in an unbroken series, Papal privi- leges, Royal charters, and the deeds of Nobles and Princes, from the beginning of the 12th century down to the Reformation, and reaching back, at least in early narra- Sssions. tive, to transactions of the 11th century. Of the early part of that period, no other contemporary records exist, except such grants aud deeds as compose this Register. Therefore, upon their authority ultimately—by the style of these writs—by the incidental information afforded by them—by the absence of all reference to customs. 1 It must appear strange to the charter scholar, how historical antiquities could be studied at all, before the industrious Keith published his lists of Bishops, and Crawfurd his imperfect Officers of State. But a most earnestly towards the local history and early statisties of his native county of Perth, and who was fully aware of the importance of the monastic records in pursuing that study. Among deeper causes ot Superior of one of the greater monasteries is almost as frequent a witness as a Bishop ; and yet nothing has been done to collect the chronological aids from this source. Each mariner here must construct his almanacks and tables for himself, The foundation of the above list of the Abbots of Dunfermlin, was laid by a gentleman, who, in his zealous study of Scotch antiquities and history, still directed his attention tegret for his untimely death, a friend and fellow labourer may be allowed to deplore that his taste and industry should have left so few memorials :— Flere et meminisse relictum est, * The charters of David I., show that, of the lands confirmed by him, the greater part flowed from the grants of his father and brothers,
