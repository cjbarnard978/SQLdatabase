James Balfour,? of four granted to our Monastery, three are found recorded in our Register, of which one is the first in order as in date of the Roman Bulls.? In like manner, the volume of Original Charters* colleeted by Balfour, has preserved the originals of three charters’ recorded ; and the minute correspondence of the record with the original writs, in all those eases, furnishes a satisfactory criterion of the ‘It is printed exactly from Balfour's MS, in the Appendix, N. 595, Without entering into a discus- sion regarding theauthenticity of this apoeryphal deed, one or two pomts may be indicated which render it at least most suspicious. The original hasnever beenseen. It is not mentioned in the Register. The style af Htusi- Jeus, though adopted in a seal of a succeeding king, is a Saxon affectation, not likely to have oceurred to Mal- ecolm Canmore, and very likely to have been invented by some Scoteh defender of the independence, when that eame into dispute. The Earls and Barons are too ostentatiously put forward, at a time when it may be doubted if their respective ranks were quite ascertained or named. The acquiescence of the people must be spoken of hereafter. If this is a forgery, the phrase has of course been copied from the charters of David and his suceessors. The punning translation, mons infirmorum, of the Celtic descriptive appellation of Dunfermlin is like the trick of a more artificial age. All the lands derived from Malcolm are here; while it would seem, from the terms of David's confirmations, Fothnf eame by a separate gift, whether written or oral. There is reason to suspect that Muselburge was not a vame in the days of Canmore, though the place was conveyed by the name of Inneresk. The witnesses are remarkable. The deed hears to be testi- monio Episcoporum, &c.; and in subsequent early charters the Bishops seem alone ta have affixed their erassof subscription. But here there is not one Bishop. It might be dangerous to give names that would afford easy tests of genuineness. Then, without dwelling on Ivo the Culdee Abbot, and Earls M*Duff and Duncan, names, which might be guessed at any ante-reeord period of Seoteh history, we have an Earl Araldus, who is not known ever to have existed, and a person af the peculiar name of Nes son of William, of whom we know nothing in Canmore’s time, while a Nes son of William isa frequent witness about a century later. Could the writer of the charter have adopted the name carelessly from a charter of Maleolm 1V., which he may have mistaken for one of Canmore # = Adv. Libr. MSS,, 15. 1. 9. * These originals are printed verhatim in the Ap- pendix. It will be ohserved that N. 597 corresponds with N. 286, N. 598 with N. 276, and N. 600 with N. 280. ‘Mss. Adv. Libr., 15.1.8. 5 N. 596 of the Appendix is the original of N. 4, N. 598, of N. 125, and N, 603,of N. 298, The eharter of the Chureh of Kinross by Bishop Lamberton, print- ed trom the original, Appendiz, N. 604, is not to be found in the Register. It probably supplies one at three charters regarding Kinross, which occupied the 94th leaf when the * Tabill” was prefixed, which leaf’ —injuria enjusdam seissoris—as Maefarlan’s copyist has it, is new wanting. This charter of the Bishop is evidently the conelusion of the transaction record- ed in N.351. It has been eut out befie the time of Lord Haddington, 1G/
