XX PREFACE. As far as that reign, the leading part—the reeord of Royal Charters—is uniform. and apparently the work of one scribe, With the reign of Alexander III. begins a different hand and far less eareful form of registering. There is no longer the methodieal el. eation of deeds, nor the rubricated titles and ornamented initial letters. We find few deeds of the period of the troubles that followed the death of Alexander III.; and if it may be allowed to conjecture, there was probably no registering during that disturbed time. When order was restored under Robert, the Reeord las been again brought into nse, and the entries of deeds of that period and subsequently, appear to have been made soon after the date of each writ :— not, however, in any regular classification, and mixed frequently with others of a much more anetent date, registered at the same time and in the same hand, undisgnisedly. Tt will be observed, the Chartulary goes no farther back than the remodelling of the Monastery by David I. The earlier part, which alone is likely to be called in question, must have been written in the time of his great-grandson, if net even sooner; and it happens singularly that the leading Charter of eaeh reign so fits inte that of the preeeding, that a fraud is rendered impossible, unless we suppose it perpetrated by the Sovereign or his Chancellor. Our Register does not Jose in authority by an omission whieh must now be mentioned, In the second volume of the I/exasticon, Dugdale has printed a deed purporting to be the foundation charter of Dunfermlin by Malcolm IIT., on the authority of Sir James Balfour, who then stood high im estimation, We have been able to trace this to the eopy in Balfour’s own hand ;' but nowhere is any indication viven of the souree from which he copied it. He uses indeed the phrase, concordat cum autographo: but that must not go for much with those who know the ‘ Lyone.” His inacenraey, for one at all addicted to historical investigation, is beyond all nple. The Charter, however, has been received and copied by succeeding anti- quari vho have endeavoured to reconcile it with history with indifferent snecess.
