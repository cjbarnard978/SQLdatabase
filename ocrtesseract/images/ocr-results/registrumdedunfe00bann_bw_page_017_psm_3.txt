PREFACE. xi Who were the first oceupants of the Abbey, we do not find. Lt has been gene- rally stated that the house was only a Priory until the time of David,—an opinion which seems to have no other fonudation than the oceurrenece of a Peter, Prior of Dunfermlin, among the ambassadors to England in 1120.' It eannct now be neces- sary, even in Seotland, to remark, that the existence of a Prier does not preelnde the existence of an Abbot. David I. appears to have remodelled the original foundation, and to have placed in it an Abbot and twelve monks from Canterbury? The Chureh, as completed or restored by hin, was dedicated in 1150." David's first Abbot was Geoflry, formerly Prior of Canterbury, cir relégionis eximie. He was ordained by Bishop Robert of Saint Andrews in 1128.7 died in 1154, and was succeeded by his nephew of the same name.® Galfridus the second died in f178.° Archibald, or Erkenbald, was the next Abbot. lt would appear that the use of the initial letter only of his name in instruments, has produced the mistake of iving Alans as the name of the Abbot in his time.” Archibald died in 1198,” Robert de Berewick was his suceessor,’ who was deposed, probably for irregu- larities, by the Cardinal Legate John de Salerno. a.p. 1202.1" Patriek, sub-prior of Durham, was chosen to succeed him.” He is a witness in transactions along with William de Malvoisin, Bishop of St. Andrews,” and it must have been during his incumbency that that lordly prelate is said to have levied on the Abbey the mulct of no less than twe churehes, for supplying wine too scantily in the Bishop’s chamber, when visiting Dunfermlin.” We hear of no other Abbot til] William; and all we have recorded of him is his death in 1238.4 ~ Galfridus prior ejusdem dommus suecessit, He died in 1240, His successor was Robert, a monk of the convent, of the local surname of Kel- delecht,—probably the same name which, after passing through many phases, has A at but held the office only two years.
